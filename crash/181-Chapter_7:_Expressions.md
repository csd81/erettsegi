## Chapter 7: Expressions (C++)

### Introduction to Expressions

Expressions form the heart of programming languages, and C++ is no exception. An **expression** in C++ is any valid combination of operators, variables, literals, and function calls that computes to a value. Expressions are critical, as they're fundamental building blocks that control logic, arithmetic operations, and decision-making processes within code.

### Categories of Expressions

In C++, expressions are broadly categorized as:

- **Arithmetic Expressions:** Handle numeric computations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- **Relational Expressions:** Perform comparisons (`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
- **Logical Expressions:** Deal with boolean logic (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- **Assignment Expressions:** Assign values to variables (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.)
- **Increment/Decrement Expressions:** Modify the value of variables (`++`, `--`)
- **Bitwise Expressions:** Manipulate individual bits (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`)
- **Conditional Expressions:** Ternary conditional operator (`?:`)
- **Comma Expressions:** Allow multiple expressions in a sequence separated by commas (`,`)

---

### Arithmetic Expressions

Arithmetic expressions in C++ involve numeric computations:

```cpp
int result = (10 + 5) * 2; // Evaluates to 30
```

C++ follows a well-defined precedence and associativity order, where multiplication/division has higher precedence than addition/subtraction. Parentheses alter this order explicitly.

---

### Relational and Logical Expressions

These expressions evaluate to Boolean values (`true` or `false`):

```cpp
bool comparison = (a > b); // true if a is greater than b
bool logical = (x > 10) && (y < 20); // true if both conditions hold
```

Logical expressions are fundamental in controlling flow in conditionals (`if`, `while`, `for`) and decision-making logic.

---

### Assignment Expressions

Assignment expressions involve assigning computed values to variables:

```cpp
int a;
a = 5; // Assigns 5 to a

a += 10; // Equivalent to a = a + 10, result: a is now 15
```

Assignment operators like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=` are concise ways to perform operations and assign results back to the same variable.

---

### Increment/Decrement Expressions

Increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) expressions modify a variable's value by one:

```cpp
int counter = 5;
counter++; // counter is now 6
--counter; // counter is now back to 5
```

They can be **prefix** or **postfix**, affecting evaluation differently:

- **Prefix (`++x`, `--x`)**: The variable is incremented or decremented before being evaluated.
- **Postfix (`x++`, `x--`)**: The variable is evaluated first, then modified.

Example:

```cpp
int x = 10;
int y = x++; // y = 10, then x becomes 11
int z = ++x; // x becomes 12, then z = 12
```

---

### Bitwise Expressions

Bitwise expressions allow direct manipulation of individual bits within an integer type. Operators include:

- `&` (bitwise AND)
- `|` (bitwise OR)
- `^` (bitwise XOR)
- `~` (bitwise NOT, unary operator)
- `<<` (left shift)
- `>>` (right shift)

Example:

```cpp
int a = 6;   // 0110 in binary
int b = 12;  // 1100 in binary
int c = a & b; // 0100 (4 in decimal)
int d = a | b; // 1110 (14 in decimal)
```

These expressions are used extensively in low-level programming, including embedded systems, graphics, cryptography, and performance-critical applications.

---

### Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator)

Conditional expressions use the ternary operator `?:`, providing a concise way to represent conditional logic:

```cpp
int max = (a > b) ? a : b; // Assigns a if a>b, else b
```

This simplifies basic if-else assignments into compact one-liners.

---

### Comma Expressions

Comma expressions combine multiple expressions into a single statement, evaluating from left to right. The value of the entire expression is the last one evaluated:

```cpp
int x;
int y = (x = 5, x + 2); // x is assigned 5, y becomes 7
```

Though less common, they are particularly helpful in `for` loops and certain initialization sequences.

---

### Operator Precedence and Associativity

Operator precedence and associativity determine the order in which expressions are evaluated. A simplified precedence hierarchy is:

1. Parentheses `()`
2. Unary operators (`++`, `--`, `!`, `~`)
3. Multiplicative operators (`*`, `/`, `%`)
4. Additive operators (`+`, `-`)
5. Shift operators (`<<`, `>>`)
6. Relational operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`)
7. Equality operators (`==`, `!=`)
8. Bitwise AND (`&`)
9. Bitwise XOR (`^`)
10. Bitwise OR (`|`)
11. Logical AND (`&&`)
12. Logical OR (`||`)
13. Conditional (`?:`)
14. Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
15. Comma (`,`)

Associativity determines evaluation when operators have equal precedence:

- **Left-to-right** associativity: most binary operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
- **Right-to-left** associativity: assignment (`=`), unary (`!`, `~`, `++`, `--` prefix).

---

### Evaluation Order and Side Effects

Understanding evaluation order is crucial because some expressions have **side effects**, altering states beyond returning a value. For instance, assignments and increments affect state.

Example with side effects:

```cpp
int i = 0;
int result = (++i) + (i++); 
// Undefined behavior in older standards, defined explicitly in later standards
```

Avoid code relying on evaluation order where it's ambiguous, to maintain clarity and portability.

---

### Type Conversions in Expressions

Expressions can implicitly or explicitly convert data types:

- **Implicit conversions**: Automatically handled by C++:
```cpp
double x = 10; // 10 implicitly converts to 10.0
```

- **Explicit conversions (casts)**: Programmer-initiated:
```cpp
double y = 7.3;
int z = static_cast<int>(y); // z becomes 7
```

---

### Constant Expressions (`constexpr`)

C++ supports compile-time evaluated expressions through the keyword `constexpr`, improving efficiency and performance:

```cpp
constexpr int size = 10 * 5; // evaluated at compile time
```

---

### Conclusion

Expressions in C++ are foundational, representing how the program performs calculations, makes decisions, and manages control flow. Mastering expressions means understanding operator precedence, evaluation order, side effects, and data conversionsâ€”critical skills to writing robust, efficient, and clear code in C++.
