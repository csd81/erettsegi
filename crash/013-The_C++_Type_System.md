Here’s a clear and concise summary of **The C++ Type System** section:

## **The C++ Type System — Summary**

### **1. Objects in C++**
- C++ is an **object-oriented language**.
- **Objects** represent real-world concepts with:
  - **State**: The current condition or properties of the object (e.g., a light switch being on or off).
  - **Behavior**: The actions the object can perform (e.g., toggling between on and off).

---

### **2. What is a Type?**
- A **type** is a collection of an object’s state and behavior.
- In other words, the type defines:
  - What kind of data an object can hold.
  - What operations or actions can be performed on that data.

---

### **3. Strong Typing in C++**
- C++ is a **strongly typed** language:
  - Every object must have a predefined data type.
  - The type determines what values can be stored and how they can be manipulated.

---

### **4. Example: The `int` Type**
- C++ has a built-in **`int`** type for whole numbers.
  - **State**: Stores integer values.
  - **Behavior**: Supports mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo).

---

### **5. Variables**
- To use these types, you create **variables**, which are **named objects** that hold data.

If you’d like, I can give you a quick overview of other built-in C++ types (like `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`) — want me to include that?
