### Exit Status

- The `main` function returns an integer (`int`) called the **exit status**.
- The meaning of these return values depends on the system environment.
- Typically, on modern desktop systems:
  - **`0`** indicates the program completed **successfully**.
  - A **nonzero value** usually indicates an **error** or abnormal termination.
- If no return value is explicitly stated in `main`, the compiler implicitly inserts `return 0;`.

**Example:**

```cpp
int main() {
    // successful execution
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern ensures portability and standard behavior across different systems.
