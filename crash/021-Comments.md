Here’s a concise and clear summary of the **Comments** section you provided:

## **Comments in C++ — Summary**

### **1. Purpose of Comments**
- Comments are human-readable notes in your code that are ignored by the compiler.
- They help explain the purpose or logic of code for yourself and others.

---

### **2. Single-Line Comments**
- Use `//` for single-line or inline comments:  
  ```cpp
  // This comment is on its own line
  int the_answer = 42; // This is an in-line comment
  ```

---

### **3. Multi-Line Comments**
- Use `/* ... */` for comments spanning multiple lines:  
  ```cpp
  /*
   * This is a comment
   * that lives on multiple lines
   * Don't forget to close it!
   */
  ```
- The `*` symbols at the beginning of each line are optional and just for style.

---

### **4. When to Use Comments**
- Some programmers argue code should be self-explanatory through:  
  - Clear variable names  
  - Short, focused functions  
  - Good tests  
- Others prefer liberal use of comments to ensure clarity.  
- Ultimately, it’s up to you to develop your own style.

> The key takeaway: The compiler completely ignores comments, so they only exist for human understanding.
