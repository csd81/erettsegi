### ✅ **TL;DR: Setting Up C++ Development on macOS with Xcode**

---

### **1. Install Xcode**
- Open the **App Store**.
- Search for **Xcode** and install it (may take up to an hour).
- After installation, open **Terminal** and navigate to your project directory.

---

### **2. Quick Compilation & Execution via Terminal**
- Compile:
```bash
clang++ main.cpp -o hello
```
- Run:
```bash
./hello
```
- You should see:
```
Hello, world!
```

---

### **3. Compiling and Running in the Xcode IDE**
1. Open **Xcode**.
2. Go to **File → New → Project**.
3. Select **macOS → Command Line Tool**, then click **Next**.
4. Name the project (e.g., `hello`) and set **Language** to **C++**.  
5. Import your `main.cpp` code by either:
   - Copy-pasting it into Xcode’s generated `main.cpp`, or  
   - Using Finder to replace the generated file with your own.  
6. Click **Run**.
