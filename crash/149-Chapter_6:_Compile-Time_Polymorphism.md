## **Chapter 6: Compile-Time Polymorphism**

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows entities, such as functions or classes, to have multiple forms or behaviors. C++ supports two major forms of polymorphism:

- **Compile-Time Polymorphism** (Static Polymorphism)
- **Runtime Polymorphism** (Dynamic Polymorphism)

In this chapter, we will focus exclusively on **Compile-Time Polymorphism**, examining its mechanisms, uses, and advantages.

### **1. Understanding Compile-Time Polymorphism**

Compile-time polymorphism is a type of polymorphism resolved during compilation. It's also referred to as **static polymorphism** because decisions about which function or template to invoke are made at compile time rather than runtime. This approach contrasts with runtime polymorphism, where decisions happen at runtime via virtual functions and pointers to base classes.

Compile-time polymorphism in C++ is primarily achieved by two methods:

- **Function Overloading**
- **Templates (Function and Class Templates)**

Let's explore each of these in detail.

---

### **2. Function Overloading**

Function overloading allows multiple functions to share the same name but have different parameter lists. The compiler determines the appropriate function to invoke based on the number, type, and order of arguments provided.

#### **Example of Function Overloading:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void print(int a) {
    std::cout << "Integer: " << a << std::endl;
}

void print(double a) {
    std::cout << "Double: " << a << std::endl;
}

void print(std::string a) {
    std::cout << "String: " << a << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    print(5);           // Calls print(int)
    print(3.14);        // Calls print(double)
    print("Hello!");    // Calls print(std::string)
    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, the correct `print` function to execute is chosen by the compiler based on the argument types. This process is called **name mangling**, enabling function overloading.

---

### **3. Operator Overloading**

Another form of compile-time polymorphism closely related to function overloading is operator overloading. Operator overloading allows existing operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `<<`, etc.) to be redefined for user-defined data types.

#### **Example of Operator Overloading:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;

    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overloading the '+' operator
    Complex operator+(const Complex& obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }

    void display() {
        std::cout << real << " + " << imag << "i\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(2, 3), c2(4, 5);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // operator+ is invoked here
    c3.display();          // Output: 6 + 8i
    return 0;
}
```

Operator overloading enhances readability, makes user-defined types intuitive, and is resolved entirely at compile time.

### **4. Templates in C++**

Templates allow the creation of generic functions or classes capable of working with various data types without repeating code. Templates represent powerful tools for compile-time polymorphism because the compiler generates specialized versions for each data type used, based on the generic template provided.

Templates come in two varieties:

- **Function Templates**
- **Class Templates**

---

#### **4.1 Function Templates**

Function templates define generic functions that can operate on different data types.

#### **Example of Function Templates:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    std::cout << add(5, 10) << std::endl;      // Output: 15 (int)
    std::cout << add(3.5, 4.5) << std::endl;   // Output: 8.0 (double)
    return 0;
}
```

The compiler automatically generates specific functions for `int` and `double` at compile-time, achieving static polymorphism.

---

#### **4.2 Class Templates**

Class templates allow creation of generic classes that are adaptable to different data types.

#### **Example of Class Templates:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
class Box {
private:
    T data;
public:
    Box(T d) : data(d) {}

    void display() {
        std::cout << "Data: " << data << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Box<int> b1(42);
    Box<std::string> b2("Hello");

    b1.display();  // Data: 42
    b2.display();  // Data: Hello

    return 0;
}
```

The compiler automatically generates distinct class versions tailored for each data type provided.

### **5. Advantages of Compile-Time Polymorphism**

Compile-time polymorphism offers several benefits compared to runtime polymorphism:

- **Performance:**  
  There's no runtime overhead because the selection of appropriate functions/classes occurs during compilation, eliminating dynamic dispatch costs.

- **Type Safety:**  
  Compile-time polymorphism ensures strong type checking, catching potential errors during compilation.

- **Flexibility and Reusability:**  
  Templates and overloading enhance reusability and adaptability, reducing code duplication significantly.

- **Inline Expansion:**  
  Compile-time decisions facilitate inline expansion of functions, leading to potentially faster code execution.

---

### **6. Limitations of Compile-Time Polymorphism**

Despite its advantages, compile-time polymorphism also has some limitations:

- **Code Bloat:**  
  Excessive template usage might lead to generated code being replicated for each data type, potentially increasing the executable's size.

- **Longer Compilation Times:**  
  Heavy usage of templates and overloading can substantially lengthen compilation times due to complexity and code generation.

- **Less Dynamic Flexibility:**  
  Unlike runtime polymorphism, compile-time polymorphism does not support decisions based on user input or external runtime conditions.

---

### **7. Best Practices for Compile-Time Polymorphism**

To effectively leverage compile-time polymorphism:

- **Balance Usage:**  
  Avoid overusing templates; balance static polymorphism with runtime polymorphism when dynamic behavior is required.

- **Clear Function Signatures:**  
  Keep overloaded functions distinct and intuitive. Avoid ambiguous overloads that confuse compilers.

- **Explicit Specializations:**  
  Utilize explicit specializations for templates to optimize performance and functionality for specific data types.

- **Use constexpr:**  
  Leverage `constexpr` for compile-time evaluated expressions, further enhancing compile-time optimizations.

---

### **Conclusion**

Compile-time polymorphism in C++—primarily via function overloading, operator overloading, and templates—provides powerful tools for developing efficient, type-safe, and reusable code. Understanding these concepts and leveraging their strengths allows developers to build robust, optimized, and maintainable software.
