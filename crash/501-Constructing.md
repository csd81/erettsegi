### âœ… **Summary: Constructing `std::string_view`**

The `std::string_view` class is a lightweight, non-owning view of a string and supports several ways to construct it:

### âœ… **Ways to construct a `string_view`:**
| **Construction Method**                | **Description**                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Default constructor**                | Creates an empty `string_view` with size `0` and `data()` pointing to `nullptr`.                     |
| **From `const std::string&`**          | Implicitly constructs a view of the contents of a `std::string`.                                     |
| **From C-string (`const char*`)**      | Implicitly constructs a view of the entire null-terminated C-string.                                  |
| **From `const char*` and `size_t`**   | Creates a view of a string with an explicitly defined length (useful for substrings or embedded nulls).|

### âœ… **Example (Listing 15-19):**
```cpp
// Default construction:
std::string_view view;
REQUIRE(view.data() == nullptr);
REQUIRE(view.size() == 0);
REQUIRE(view.empty());

// Construct from std::string:
std::string word("sacrosanct");
std::string_view view(word);
REQUIRE(view == "sacrosanct");

// Construct from C-string:
auto word = "viewership";
std::string_view view(word);
REQUIRE(view == "viewership");

// Construct from C-string and length:
std::string_view view(word, 4);
REQUIRE(view == "view");
```

---

### âœ… **Key Design Note:**
- `string_view` supports copy construction and assignment.
- It **does not** support move construction or assignment â€” since it doesn't own the data, moving it wouldn't provide any efficiency gain.

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:**  
`std::string_view` can be constructed from strings, string literals, or pointers and lengths, making it extremely flexible for referencing string data without copying.
