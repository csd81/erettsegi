### ✅ **TL;DR: Setting Up Your C++ Development Environment**

---

### **1. Key Components of a C++ Development Environment**
- **Source code editor** — where you write your C++ code.
- **Compiler toolchain** — converts your code into an executable program.
- **Debugger** — helps you step through your program line by line to find and fix errors.

---

### **2. What is an IDE?**
- An **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** bundles:  
  - Text editor  
  - Compiler  
  - Debugger  
- IDEs are great for beginners and professionals alike, making development smoother and more productive.

---

### **3. No Interactive Interpreter for C++**
- Unlike Python, Ruby, or JavaScript, C++ does **not** have a built-in interpreter.
- But there are helpful web-based tools:
  - ✅ [Wandbox](https://wandbox.org/) — compile and run C++ code online.  
  - ✅ [Compiler Explorer](https://www.godbolt.org/) — see the assembly your C++ code generates, compare compilers, and test snippets.

### **4. Choose Your Setup by OS**
- The book and setup instructions are broken down by OS:
  - **Windows** — Visual Studio + MSVC
  - **macOS** — Xcode + clang++
  - **Linux** — GCC / Clang via package managers or source
- Jump to the section for your system and follow step-by-step.
