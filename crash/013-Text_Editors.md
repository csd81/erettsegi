Here’s a clean and concise summary of the **Text Editors** and **Bootstrapping C++** sections:

---

## **Text Editors — Summary**
- You don’t have to use a full IDE; you can write C++ code in simple text editors like:
  - **Notepad** (Windows)
  - **TextEdit** (Mac)
  - **Vim or Emacs** (Linux) — with available C++ plug-ins.
- However, using an editor or IDE designed for C++ development can improve productivity.
  
### **Recommended C++ IDEs/Editors:**
- **Windows/macOS:**  
  - Visual Studio  
  - Xcode  
- **Linux:**  
  - Qt Creator ([qt.io/ide](https://www.qt.io/ide/))  
  - Eclipse CDT ([eclipse.org/cdt](https://eclipse.org/cdt/))  
  - JetBrains CLion ([jetbrains.com/clion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)) — paid but offers free/reduced licenses for students and open-source contributors.

> ✏️ **Tip:** Choose the development environment that helps you stay focused and productive.
