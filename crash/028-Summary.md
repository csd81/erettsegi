### **Summary of Chapter 1**
This chapter guided you through setting up a C++ development environment and compiling your first C++ program. It introduced the components of a build toolchain, explaining how they work together during compilation. You also learned foundational C++ topics, including data types, variable declarations, statements, conditionals, functions, and how to use `printf`. The chapter concluded with a tutorial on configuring a debugger and walking through your code step by step.

### **Exercises**
1. **absolute_value function**: Write a function `absolute_value` that returns the absolute value of an integer.  
2. **Test different inputs**: Run your program with various values to confirm the output.  
3. **Debugging**: Use a debugger to step through the program line by line.  
4. **sum function**: Create a `sum` function that takes two integers and returns their sum; modify your existing template to test it.  
5. **Explore the community**:  
   - Listen to the CppCast podcast.  
   - Watch CppCon and C++Now talks on YouTube.  
   - Bookmark [cppreference.com](https://cppreference.com) and [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com).  
6. **Download the C++17 standard**: Get the free draft version from [isocpp.org](https://isocpp.org/std/the-standard/).
