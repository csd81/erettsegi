Here’s a simple, clear summary of the **Xcode Debugging** section you shared:

---

## **Debugging with Xcode — Summary**

### **1. Setting a Breakpoint**
- Open `main.cpp`.
- Click on the first line of `main()`.
- Go to **Debug → Breakpoints → Add Breakpoint at Current Line**.  
  - A breakpoint marker will appear.

---

### **2. Running and Halting Execution**
- Click **Run**.  
- The program will execute up to the breakpoint and pause.  
- A green arrow will show the next instruction to be executed.

---

### **3. Debugging Controls in Xcode**
- **Step Over (F6)**:  
  Executes the current line without going into function calls.
- **Step Into (F7)**:  
  Steps into a function call and pauses at the first line inside that function.
- **Step Out (F8)**:  
  Executes the remaining lines of the current function and returns to the calling function.

---

### **4. Inspecting Variables**
- Look at the **Autos window** at the bottom of the screen.  
- You can see current variable values at the breakpoint.  
  - Example: `num1 = 42`, `result1 = 1`.  
  - Variables not yet initialized will show garbage values (for example, `num2` before it's assigned 0).

### **5. Learn More**
- Xcode's debugger has additional advanced features.  
- Official documentation: [https://ccc.codes/](https://ccc.codes/)
