## **`constexpr` Lambda Expressions**

Lambda expressions in C++ can be evaluated at compile-time, making them **`constexpr`**, provided they meet certain requirements.

### Key Points:

- **Implicit constexpr**:
  - Lambdas are automatically considered `constexpr` if they can be evaluated at compile time.
  
- **Explicit constexpr**:
  - You can explicitly mark a lambda as `constexpr` for clarity and to enforce compile-time evaluation constraints:
  
    ```cpp
    [] (int x) constexpr { return x * x; }
    ```

### Current (`C++17`) Constraints for `constexpr` Lambdas:

- **No dynamic memory allocations**.
- **Can only invoke other constexpr functions**.
- Must follow general `constexpr` restrictions (no runtime-only constructs).

These restrictions are gradually relaxed with newer C++ standards, so staying updated on the latest rules is essential if you rely heavily on `constexpr` code.
