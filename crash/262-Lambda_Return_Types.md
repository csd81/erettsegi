## **Lambda Return Types in C++**

By default, the compiler automatically deduces a lambda’s return type based on its return statements. However, you can explicitly specify the return type yourself using the syntax:

### Explicit Return Type Syntax:
```cpp
[](parameters) -> return_type { /* body */ }
```

### Examples:

**Simple explicit return type**:
```cpp
[](int x, double y) -> double { 
    return x + y; 
}
```

- Accepts an `int` and a `double`, returns a `double`.

**Using `decltype` for generic lambdas**:
```cpp
[](auto x, double y) -> decltype(x + y) { 
    return x + y; 
}
```

- Return type dynamically deduced from expression (`x + y`).

### Notes:

- Usually, explicitly specifying a lambda’s return type is unnecessary because the compiler can reliably deduce it.
- Explicit return types (`->`) are helpful mainly when:
  - The return type isn't clear or obvious.
  - You want more control over type deduction, particularly with **generic lambdas**.
