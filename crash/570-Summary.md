### âœ… **Summary of the Chapter (Filesystem)**  
In this chapter, you learned about:  
- **`std::filesystem` facilities**:  
  Including `path`, file and directory manipulation, and structured error handling.  
- **Cross-platform file operations**:  
  These tools allow writing code that works on Windows, Linux, and macOS without modification.  
- **Directory iterators**:  
  Both `directory_iterator` (non-recursive) and `recursive_directory_iterator` (recursive search), and how to use them with `directory_options` for handling permission issues.  
- **Integration with file streams**:  
  Demonstrating how `std::ifstream`, `std::ofstream`, and `std::fstream` can take `std::filesystem::path` directly as input, making it seamless to iterate through directories and process files.  

The chapter concluded with real-world examples â€” like checking Windows PE files for magic bytes â€” and showed how `filesystem` provides both power and simplicity for robust file handling.

### âœ… **EXERCISES (Recap)**  

**17-1**:  
Write a program that:  
- Takes two arguments: a path and a file extension (like `.txt`)  
- Recursively searches the given path  
- Prints the full paths of all matching files  

---

**17-2**:  
Modify Listing 17-8 (a file search program) so that:  
- If the first argument starts with `-`, treat the following letters as options (ex: `-R`)  
- If `R` is present in options, perform a recursive search  
- Otherwise, search only one level deep  
- The next argument is the path to search  

---

**17-3**:  
Refer to `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Linux) command documentation, and:  
- Implement as many features as you can (sorting, displaying file sizes, showing hidden files, formatting output, etc.)  
- Make your program a more powerful directory listing tool

### âœ… **Further Reading (Recommendations)**  
- *Windows NT File System Internals: A Developerâ€™s Guide* by Rajeev Nagar  
- *The Boost C++ Libraries* by Boris SchÃ¤ling â€” for advanced C++ filesystem and library usage  
- *The Linux Programming Interface* by Michael Kerrisk â€” excellent for understanding how filesystem and OS-level file interactions work in Linux
