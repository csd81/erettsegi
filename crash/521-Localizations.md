Here's a concise summary of the provided text:

A **locale** in C++ encodes cultural and regional preferences, influencing things like string comparisons, formatting for dates, times, currency, numbers, postal codes, and phone numbers. The Standard Template Library (STL) provides the `std::locale` class, along with helper functions and classes defined in the `<locale>` header, for handling localization needs.

However, due to brevity and the book's primary English-speaking audience, locales aren't explored further in this chapter.
