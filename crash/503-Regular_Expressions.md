That’s a nice little summary of regexes!  

To expand on it a bit:  

- In C++, the `<regex>` header gives you `std::regex`, `std::regex_match`, `std::regex_search`, and `std::regex_replace`, plus regex iterators.  
- Regex syntax itself can feel cryptic at first:  
  - `.` matches any character  
  - `*` means “zero or more”  
  - `+` means “one or more”  
  - `[...]` denotes a character class  
  - `()` for grouping, and `|` for OR  
  - `^` and `$` for start and end of line  
- In C++ regex, by default it uses ECMAScript syntax, which is very close to what you see in most languages.  

Would you like me to show some simple C++ regex examples or maybe break down regex syntax cheatsheet-style?
