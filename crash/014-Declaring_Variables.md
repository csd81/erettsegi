Here’s a simple and clear summary of the **Declaring Variables** section you shared:

---

## **Declaring Variables in C++ — Summary**

### **1. Syntax for Declaring a Variable**
- A variable declaration consists of:  
  **type** + **variable name** + **semicolon (`;`)**
  
> Example:
```cpp
int the_answer;
```
- **`int`** (u) is the type.  
- **`the_answer`** (v) is the variable name.

---

### **2. What Happens When You Declare?**
- Declaring a variable reserves space in memory for storing data of the given type.
- You can later assign or initialize values to it.

Would you like me to show examples with different types (like `float`, `char`, `bool`), or maybe how to declare multiple variables in one line?
