### âœ… **Summary: `std::string_view`**

A **string view** is a lightweight object that represents a constant, contiguous sequence of characters. It behaves similarly to a `const std::string&` but:
- Does **not own** the data it points to.
- Is typically implemented as a **pointer + length**.

### âœ… **C++ Specializations of `std::basic_string_view` (in `<string_view>`):**
| **Type**      | **String view specialization** |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| `char`        | `std::string_view`             |
| `wchar_t`     | `std::wstring_view`            |
| `char16_t`    | `std::u16string_view`          |
| `char32_t`    | `std::u32string_view`          |

### âœ… Key Features:
- Can be used as a **drop-in replacement for `const std::string&`** in most cases.
- Designed for efficiently passing and handling immutable sequences of characters without copying.

### ðŸ‘‰ **In short:**  
`std::string_view` and its variations allow easy, efficient access to character sequences without the overhead of owning or copying string data â€” making it ideal for function parameters and parsing scenarios.
