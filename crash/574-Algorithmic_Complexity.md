### **Algorithmic Complexity and Big O Notation**

Algorithmic complexity describes how difficult a computational task is. **Big O notation (Bachmann-Landau notation)** quantifies complexity based on how the amount of work (or computation) grows as the input size increases. Big O focuses only on the **leading term**, or the fastest-growing component, of the complexity function.

### **Common Complexity Classes**

Here are five important complexity classes with explanations and examples of standard-library (`stdlib`) operations:

| **Complexity Class** | **Notation** | **Additional Computation** *(Input increases from 1,000 → 10,000)* | **Example** |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| **Constant Time** | **O(1)** | No additional computation (constant regardless of input size). | Determining `size()` of a `std::vector`. |
| **Logarithmic Time** | **O(log N)** | ~1 additional computation. Efficiently scales with input size. | Finding an element in a `std::set`. |
| **Linear Time** | **O(N)** | ~9,000 additional computations. Proportional growth. | Summing elements in a collection. |
| **Quasilinear Time** | **O(N log N)** | ~37,000 additional computations. Scales slightly more than linearly. | Sorting elements using **quicksort**. |
| **Quadratic (Polynomial) Time** | **O(N²)** | ~99,000,000 additional computations. Rapid growth, significantly expensive. | Comparing all elements between two collections. |

### **Practical Implications**

- These complexity classes help estimate **how an algorithm scales** with input size.
- Actual performance should always be validated through **profiling**, since theoretical complexity gives only a general guideline.
- Complexity classes provide intuition on algorithmic efficiency and help developers select the right algorithms based on expected dataset sizes.
