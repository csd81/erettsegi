**TL;DR – Jump Statements**  

- Jump statements (`break`, `continue`, `goto`) forcefully transfer control flow.  
- They are not conditional by themselves — they jump when reached.  
- Modern C++ discourages their use; prefer structured control flow (loops, conditionals, functions).  
- They're still common in older C++ and C code, especially for error handling or low-level logic.
