### âœ… **Summary of Boost String Algorithms**

The **Boost String Algorithms** library provides a comprehensive set of tools for manipulating strings. It includes functions for:

- **Trimming** whitespace or custom characters
- **Case conversion** (to uppercase, lowercase)
- **Finding and replacing** substrings or patterns (with support for nth, first, last, and regex-based replacements)
- **Evaluating string characteristics** (like checking if a string starts with, ends with, or contains certain substrings)

---

### âœ… **Usage**
- All functions are available in the `boost::algorithm` namespace.
- You can include all string-related algorithms via the convenience header:
```cpp
#include <boost/algorithm/string.hpp>
```

### ðŸ‘‰ **In short:**
Boost String Algorithms is a powerful toolkit for handling strings efficiently and cleanly in C++, offering advanced features far beyond whatâ€™s in the standard library.
