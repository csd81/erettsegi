This text explains several common prefix modifiers in C++ along with their purposes and usage:

### 1. **`static`**
- **Global (non-class) functions:**  
  Indicates internal linkage, meaning the function is accessible only within the current translation unit (file). It will not be visible or callable from other files.
  
- **Class member functions (methods):**  
  Indicates the method belongs to the class itself, not a particular instance of the class. It can be called without creating an instance of the class.

### 2. **`virtual` and `override`**
- `virtual` methods can be overridden by derived (child) classes, allowing polymorphic behavior.
- `override` explicitly indicates that a method in a child class overrides a virtual method from a parent class, helping the compiler catch mistakes if the method signatures don’t match.

### 3. **`constexpr`**
- Suggests that a function should be evaluated at compile-time if possible, allowing for more efficient and optimized code.

### 4. **`[[noreturn]]`**
- Indicates to the compiler that the function will never return to the caller. For example, a function might terminate the program or loop infinitely. This helps the compiler optimize the code better.

### 5. **`inline`**
- Suggests the compiler to insert the function’s code directly at the call site, eliminating overhead associated with function calls (such as setting up a stack frame and jumps).
- Benefits:
  - Slightly faster execution (less overhead).
  - Trade-off: potentially larger binary size if the function is used frequently.
- Does not guarantee inlining; it's merely a hint. Modern compilers frequently inline small functions automatically, particularly within a single translation unit.

### Important Notes on `inline`:
- The behavior of your code remains identical, whether inlined or not.
- If you declare a function as `inline`, you must define it in every translation unit (e.g., in a header file) to avoid linkage errors.
- Modern compilers are generally efficient at deciding when to inline functions, so manual usage is typically reserved for specific optimization scenarios.
