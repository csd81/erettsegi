### ✅ **TL;DR: Libraries — Pulling in External Code**

---

### **What are Libraries?**  
- Libraries are pre-written collections of helpful code you can reuse in your programs — so you don’t have to write everything from scratch.

### **How Different Languages Import Libraries:**
| Language(s)            | Command   |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Python, Go, Java       | `import`  |
| Rust, PHP, C#          | `use` / `using` |
| JavaScript, Lua, R, Perl | `require` / `requires` |
| C and C++              | `#include` |

---

### **Example in C++**  
- In Listing 1-1, the line:
```cpp
#include <cstdio>
```
- This pulls in the **`cstdio`** library, giving access to functions like `printf()` for input/output operations.
