## **(Max) Heap Operations (`<algorithm>` header)**

A **max heap** is a data structure that efficiently supports quick lookup/removal of the maximum element and fast insertion operations. It's defined such that, for a heap of length `N`:

- For each index `0 < i < N`, the condition is:
  ```
  element[(i - 1) / 2] >= element[i]
  ```

### Heap-related Algorithms:

| Algorithm           | Description                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **`is_heap`**       | Checks whether a range is a max heap                 |
| **`is_heap_until`** | Finds the largest subrange that forms a max heap     |
| **`make_heap`**     | Creates a max heap from a range                      |

## **Set Operations on Sorted Ranges (`<algorithm>` header)**

These algorithms perform mathematical set operations on sorted sequences:

| Algorithm                  | Description                                       |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **`includes`**             | Checks if one sorted range is a subset of another |
| **`set_difference`**       | Computes elements in set A but not in set B       |
| **`set_intersection`**     | Computes elements common to both sets             |

These algorithms provide additional numeric computations:

| Algorithm                     | Description                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`exclusive_scan`**          | Computes cumulative sums excluding the current element      |
| **`inclusive_scan`**          | Computes cumulative sums including the current element; requires associative operations |
| **`transform_reduce`**        | Applies a transformation, then reduces the sequence (allows parallel execution) |
| **`transform_exclusive_scan`**| Transforms each element, then computes an exclusive scan    |
| **`transform_inclusive_scan`**| Transforms each element, then computes an inclusive scan    |

| **`uninitialized_value_construct_n`**   | Value-constructs `n` objects in memory       |
| **`destroy_at`**                        | Destroys the object at a given address       |
| **`destroy`**                           | Destroys objects in a given range            |
