**TL;DR**  

This chapter covered different types of statements in C++: declarations, initializations, selection (if/switch), and iteration (loops). It reminded readers that `try-catch` blocks are also statements (covered earlier).  

### Exercises:  
1. Split the given Fibonacci example into separate files for `main`, `FibonacciRange`, and `FibonacciIterator`, with shared headers.  
2. Create a `PrimeNumberRange` class to iterate over prime numbers below a given value, using headers and source files.  
3. Add prime number iteration (below 5000) to the existing Fibonacci example.
