### The `main` Function and Command-Line Arguments

Every C++ program must include a global function named **`main`**.

- **Purpose of `main`:**
  - Serves as the **entry point** of the program.
  - Automatically invoked when the program starts.

- **Command-line Parameters:**
  - Programs can accept arguments provided by the environment upon startup.
  - Known as **command-line parameters** or **arguments**.
  - Allow users to customize program behavior without recompiling.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  $ copy file_a.txt file_b.txt
  ```
  - Here, `copy` is the program, and `file_a.txt`, `file_b.txt` are command-line arguments instructing the program to copy the first file into the second.

- **Handling Command-line Arguments:**
  - Whether your program handles command-line arguments is determined by how you declare your `main` function.
  - Common declarations include:
    ```cpp
    int main();                                // Does NOT accept arguments
    int main(int argc, char* argv[]);          // Accepts arguments
    ```
