                Creating Your First C++ Source File
                Open your favorite text editor. If you donâ€™t have a favorite just yet, try Vim,
                Emacs, or gedit on Linux; TextEdit on Mac; or Notepad on Windows. Enter
                the code in Listing 1-1 and save the resulting file to your desktop as main.cpp.

                #include <cstdio> u

                int mainv(){
                  printf("Hello, world!"); w
                  return 0; x
                }
