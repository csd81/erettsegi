This section of the text is giving an intro to using Boost.Asio for network programming.  

Here’s a smoother rephrase if you’d like to better digest it:  

> **Network Programming with Asio**  
> Boost.Asio provides tools for handling network I/O across multiple important protocols. Now that you're familiar with `io_context` and how to queue asynchronous operations, you can move on to more complex I/O tasks. In this part, you'll go beyond simple timer examples and start using Boost.Asio's networking features. By the time you're done, you'll know how to create programs that communicate over the network.  

If you’d like, I can help break down the upcoming examples or show a minimal TCP client/server setup with Boost.Asio — would that be useful?
