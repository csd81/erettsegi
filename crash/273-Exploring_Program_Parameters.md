### Exploring Program Parameters

This section demonstrates how programs receive and handle **command-line parameters** from the operating system.

### Example Program (`list_929`):

This simple C++ program prints the number and value of command-line arguments passed to it.

**Code snippet:**

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdint>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    printf("Arguments: %d\n", argc);
    for(size_t i{}; i < argc; i++) {
        printf("%zd: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- **`argc`**:
  - Stores the **count** of command-line arguments.
  - Always **at least 1** (program name itself).

- **`argv`**:
  - An array of C-style strings (`char*`) representing each argument.
  - `argv[0]` is always the name of the executable itself.

### Sample Outputs:

**Example 1:** (no arguments provided)
```bash
$ list_929
Arguments: 1
0: list_929.exe
```

- Only argument is the executable's name.

**Example 2:** (multiple arguments provided)
```bash
$ list_929 Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
Arguments: 9
0: list_929.exe
1: Violence
2: is
3: the
4: last
5: refuge
6: of
7: the
8: incompetent.
```

- The OS splits input on whitespace by default.

**Example 3:** (arguments enclosed in quotes)
```bash
$ list_929 "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."
Arguments: 2
0: list_929.exe
1: Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
```

- Quotes group arguments containing spaces into one string.
