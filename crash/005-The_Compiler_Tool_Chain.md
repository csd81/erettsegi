### ✅ **TL;DR: The Compiler Tool Chain**

---

### **What is the compiler tool chain?**  
It’s a three-step process that turns your C++ source code into an executable program:

---

### **1. Preprocessor**  
- Handles commands starting with `#` (like `#include <cstdio>`).  
- Copies header file content into your code and prepares it.  
- Produces a **translation unit** (the expanded code).

---

### **2. Compiler**  
- Takes the translation unit and compiles it into an **object file**.  
- Object files contain machine-readable **object code**, but they’re not full programs yet.  
- Each source file gets compiled into its own object file.

---

### **3. Linker**  
- Combines all object files into one final executable program.  
- Also links external **libraries** your code needs (like the `cstdio` library for `printf`).  
- Headers (like `cstdio`) tell the compiler how to use the library, but the **linker** brings in the actual code from the library.

---

> In short:  
**Source Code → (Preprocessor) → Translation Unit → (Compiler) → Object File → (Linker) → Executable Program**

If you’d like, I can draw a simple diagram for this tool chain or help show it step-by-step with real terminal output — want me to do that?
