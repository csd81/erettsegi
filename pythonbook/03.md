# **III. Python Basics**

## **1. "Hello, World!"**

Python includes a **command interpreter** where we can type and test commands one by one.

### **Typing Commands**
- At the **end of every command**, press **Enter** to execute it.
- **Spaces are flexible** within commands. For example, in `print("Hello, World!")`, it **does not matter** if there is a space after `print` or inside the parentheses.
- **Strings** (such as `"Hello, World!"`) **can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotation marks**. Both are correct:
  - ✅ `'Hello, World!'`
  - ✅ `"Hello, World!"`
  - ❌ **Mixing them** (e.g., `’Hello, World!"`) **causes an error**.

---

## **15. Sample Task – "Hello, World!"**
Traditionally, programming studies **begin with displaying** `"Hello, World!"` on the screen.

### **Steps to Run Python and Print "Hello, World!"**
1. Open Python's interpreter:
   - Click the **Start Menu** and find `Python x.x (IDLE Python x.x 64-bit)`.
2. A **`>>>` prompt** appears where you can type Python commands.
3. **Type the following command and press Enter**:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. The text `"Hello, World!"` **appears on the screen**.

This simple exercise introduces the **basic structure of Python commands** and printing output! 🚀

### **5. Enter the following command and press Enter:**
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
6. The command interpreter **displays the output in blue text**:  
   **"Hello, World!"**  
7. **Introduce an intentional mistake** by typing:
   ```python
   prit("Hello, World!")
   ```
   Then press **Enter**.
8. **An error message appears (in red text)**, alerting us that we **made a mistake** in our command. The interpreter **detects** and **explains the error**:  
   `"prit" is not defined`, meaning there is **no such command** in Python.

---

# **2. Basic Operations**

The **command interpreter** can function as a **simple calculator**.  
We can write **mathematical expressions** directly, using the `print` command.

## **16. Sample Task – Basic Operations**
### **Problem:**
Calculate **how much fencing is needed** to surround a **rectangular plot** of land  
that is **45 meters long** and **35 meters wide**, but with a **5-meter-wide gate left open**.

### **Solution:**
1. **Calculate the perimeter** and subtract the **gate length**:  
   Formula:  
   \[
   2 \times (45 + 35) - 5
   \]
2. In **computer notation**, multiplication is represented by **`*`**.  
   So in Python, we write:
   ```python
   print(2 * (45 + 35) - 5)
   ```
   Then press **Enter**.

**Note:**  
Without `print`, simply typing the formula also returns the result.  
However, **it is best practice to always use `print`** in program files! 🚀

## **17. Sample Task – Quotient, Remainder, Integer Division**

### **Task:**
Write a program that **extracts** the **ones place** and the **tens place** of the number **35**!

### **Solution:**
1. **Extracting the ones place**  
   - The **ones digit** of **35** is **5**.  
   - We get this by computing **the remainder** when dividing **35 by 10**.
   - The **modulus operator** (`%`) gives the remainder.  
   - Enter the following command in Python and press **Enter**:
     ```python
     print(35 % 10)
     ```
2. **The result (5) appears in blue text** in the command interpreter.

3. **Extracting the tens place**  
   - The **tens digit** of **35** is **3**.
   - We get this by performing **integer division** of **35 by 10**.
   - The **division operator** (`/`) gives the quotient **including decimals**.
   - Enter the following command:
     ```python
     print(35 / 10)
     ```

4. **The result (3.5) appears**.  
   - This is **not an integer**, because **Python performs floating-point division** by default.

5. **To get an integer result**, use the `int` function:
   ```python
   print(int(35 / 10))
   ```
   - The correct answer (3) appears.

### **Additional Notes:**
- In Python, **decimal fractions** are written with **dots** (e.g., `3.5`, not `3,5`).
- The `int()` function **rounds down** by **removing the decimal part**, rather than rounding normally.

---

This task introduces basic mathematical operators in Python:
- **`%`** → Remainder (modulus)
- **`/`** → Division (returns a floating-point result)
- **`int()`** → Converts to an integer (truncates decimal part)

🚀 Now you know how to break down a number into its digits using Python!

## **3. VARIABLES**

When using a calculator, we often store intermediate results in memory, so we can recall them when needed. Variables in programming languages serve the same purpose. However, since there are multiple variables, we use them differently.

A variable (with some limitations) can be given any name, and we assign it a value. Think of it as a labeled drawer in a cabinet: we name it (labeling) and place the value we want to store inside.

---

## **18. Sample Task – Using Variables**

Calculate the **perimeter** and **area** of a rectangular plot that is **35 meters long** and **25 meters wide**, while storing the **side lengths**, **perimeter**, and **area** in variables.

### **Steps:**
1. Assign **35** to the variable **a**.  
   - Enter the following command:
     ```python
     a = 35
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

2. Assign **25** to the variable **b**.  
   - Enter:
     ```python
     b = 25
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

3. Compute the **perimeter** using the formula `k = 2 * (a + b)`.  
   - Enter:
     ```python
     k = 2 * (a + b)
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

4. Compute the **area** using the formula `t = a * b`.  
   - Enter:
     ```python
     t = a * b
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

5. Print the **perimeter**:
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```
   - The output **(120)** appears.

6. Print the **area**:
   ```python
   print(t)
   ```
   - The output **(875)** appears.

7. Increase the value of **a** by **5**:  
   ```python
   a = a + 5
   ```
   - Press **Enter**.

8. Verify the new value of **a**:  
   ```python
   print(a)
   ```
   - The output is **40**, confirming the change.

---

### **Concepts Introduced:**
- **Assigning values to variables**
- **Using variables in formulas**
- **Printing variable values**
- **Updating a variable’s value**

🚀 Now you can calculate and store values efficiently in Python!

----
Here is the full English translation of the text:

---

At first, `a = a + 5` may seem strange since it is mathematically meaningless. A number cannot be equal to itself plus five. However, in Python, the `=` sign means **"assign"**, not "equals," and is not used for comparison (for that, we use `==`).  
Thus, `a = a + 5` should be read as:  
**"Assign to `a` the value of `a` increased by 5."**  
If `a` was previously **35**, this statement increases it by **5**, making it **40**.

---

### **12. In Python, there is a shorter way to increase a variable's value.**  
Increase the variable's value by **5** again, but this time using a shorter syntax:  
```python
a += 5
```
Press **Enter**.

---

### **13. Verify the new value of `a`. Print the value:**  
```python
print(a)
```
#### **14. The output displayed by the interpreter is: 45.**

---

### **15. Try the shorter syntax for decreasing a variable.**  
Reduce the value of **b** by **10** using:  
```python
b -= 10
```
Press **Enter**.

---

### **16. Verify the new value of `b`. Print the value:**  
```python
print(b)
```
#### **17. The output displayed by the interpreter is: 15.**

---

### **18. Multiple statements can be written in one line.**  
In Python, multiple commands can be written in a **single line** if separated by **commas**.  
Similarly, we can print multiple values in one line by **separating them with commas**.  

Use this technique to complete the task based on the right-side example.

---

### **Concepts Covered:**
- **Variable assignment**
- **Updating values using `+=` and `-=`**
- **Printing multiple values in a single line**
- **Using commas for separating commands**

🚀 You are now handling Python variables like a pro!

----
Here is the full English translation of the text:

---

### **Overview**  
**A variable is a reserved piece of memory that can be referenced by its name.**

#### **Rules for Naming Variables:**
- A variable name **must start with a letter** from the English alphabet.
- It **may contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`)**.
- It **cannot match any reserved keywords or commands** in Python.

---

### **Assigning Values to Variables**
The most important operation performed on a variable is **assignment**.  
The **left side** of an assignment holds the **variable name**, and the **right side** holds the **value** assigned to it.  
For example:  
```python
b = 25
```
This is read as: **"Let `b` be 25."**

Multiple variables can be assigned values in one statement, separated by commas:  
```python
a, b, c = 3, 4, 5
```

---

### **How Variables Work in Python**
When a variable is **first used**, Python **allocates memory** for it,  
**links the name to the value**, and **determines the variable’s type**.  

The type is determined **automatically**, which is necessary because **different types of data** are stored in different ways in memory.  

Python has several **data types**:
- **String (`str`)** → A sequence of characters (also called a **text string**).
- **Integer (`int`)** → Whole numbers (e.g., 3, -7, 42).
- **Floating-point (`float`)** → Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.718).
- **Boolean (`bool`)** → Logical values **True** or **False**.

---

### **Updating Variable Values**
For numeric variables, we can use shortcut operations like:
```python
a += 5  # Increases 'a' by 5
b -= 2  # Decreases 'b' by 2
c *= 3  # Multiplies 'c' by 3
```

---

### **Strongly-Typed vs. Weakly-Typed Languages**
In many programming languages like **C++, C#, or Pascal**, variables must be **explicitly declared** before use.  
These languages are called **strongly-typed languages**.  
In contrast, **Python and Basic** automatically determine types, so they are considered **weakly-typed languages**.

🚀 **With this knowledge, you can now efficiently use variables in Python!**
