# **III. Python Basics**

## **1. "Hello, World!"**

Python includes a **command interpreter** where we can type and test commands one by one.

### **Typing Commands**
- At the **end of every command**, press **Enter** to execute it.
- **Spaces are flexible** within commands. For example, in `print("Hello, World!")`, it **does not matter** if there is a space after `print` or inside the parentheses.
- **Strings** (such as `"Hello, World!"`) **can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotation marks**. Both are correct:
  - ✅ `'Hello, World!'`
  - ✅ `"Hello, World!"`
  - ❌ **Mixing them** (e.g., `’Hello, World!"`) **causes an error**.

## **15. Sample Task – "Hello, World!"**
Traditionally, programming studies **begin with displaying** `"Hello, World!"` on the screen.

### **Steps to Run Python and Print "Hello, World!"**
1. Open Python's interpreter:
   - Click the **Start Menu** and find `Python x.x (IDLE Python x.x 64-bit)`.
2. A **`>>>` prompt** appears where you can type Python commands.
3. **Type the following command and press Enter**:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. The text `"Hello, World!"` **appears on the screen**.

This simple exercise introduces the **basic structure of Python commands** and printing output! 🚀

### **5. Enter the following command and press Enter:**
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
6. The command interpreter **displays the output in blue text**:  
   **"Hello, World!"**  
7. **Introduce an intentional mistake** by typing:
   ```python
   prit("Hello, World!")
   ```
   Then press **Enter**.
8. **An error message appears (in red text)**, alerting us that we **made a mistake** in our command. The interpreter **detects** and **explains the error**:  
   `"prit" is not defined`, meaning there is **no such command** in Python.

# **2. Basic Operations**

The **command interpreter** can function as a **simple calculator**.  
We can write **mathematical expressions** directly, using the `print` command.

## **16. Sample Task – Basic Operations**
### **Problem:**
Calculate **how much fencing is needed** to surround a **rectangular plot** of land  
that is **45 meters long** and **35 meters wide**, but with a **5-meter-wide gate left open**.

### **Solution:**
1. **Calculate the perimeter** and subtract the **gate length**:  
   Formula:  
   \[
   2 \times (45 + 35) - 5
   \]
2. In **computer notation**, multiplication is represented by **`*`**.  
   So in Python, we write:
   ```python
   print(2 * (45 + 35) - 5)
   ```
   Then press **Enter**.

**Note:**  
Without `print`, simply typing the formula also returns the result.  
However, **it is best practice to always use `print`** in program files! 🚀
