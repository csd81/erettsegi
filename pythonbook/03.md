# **III. Python Basics**

## **1. "Hello, World!"**

Python includes a **command interpreter** where we can type and test commands one by one.

### **Typing Commands**
- At the **end of every command**, press **Enter** to execute it.
- **Spaces are flexible** within commands. For example, in `print("Hello, World!")`, it **does not matter** if there is a space after `print` or inside the parentheses.
- **Strings** (such as `"Hello, World!"`) **can be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotation marks**. Both are correct:
  - ✅ `'Hello, World!'`
  - ✅ `"Hello, World!"`
  - ❌ **Mixing them** (e.g., `’Hello, World!"`) **causes an error**.

---

## **15. Sample Task – "Hello, World!"**
Traditionally, programming studies **begin with displaying** `"Hello, World!"` on the screen.

### **Steps to Run Python and Print "Hello, World!"**
1. Open Python's interpreter:
   - Click the **Start Menu** and find `Python x.x (IDLE Python x.x 64-bit)`.
2. A **`>>>` prompt** appears where you can type Python commands.
3. **Type the following command and press Enter**:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
4. The text `"Hello, World!"` **appears on the screen**.

This simple exercise introduces the **basic structure of Python commands** and printing output! 🚀

# **III. Python Basics (continued)**

### **5. Enter the following command and press Enter:**
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```
6. The command interpreter **displays the output in blue text**:  
   **"Hello, World!"**  
7. **Introduce an intentional mistake** by typing:
   ```python
   prit("Hello, World!")
   ```
   Then press **Enter**.
8. **An error message appears (in red text)**, alerting us that we **made a mistake** in our command. The interpreter **detects** and **explains the error**:  
   `"prit" is not defined`, meaning there is **no such command** in Python.

---

# **2. Basic Operations**

The **command interpreter** can function as a **simple calculator**.  
We can write **mathematical expressions** directly, using the `print` command.

## **16. Sample Task – Basic Operations**
### **Problem:**
Calculate **how much fencing is needed** to surround a **rectangular plot** of land  
that is **45 meters long** and **35 meters wide**, but with a **5-meter-wide gate left open**.

### **Solution:**
1. **Calculate the perimeter** and subtract the **gate length**:  
   Formula:  
   \[
   2 \times (45 + 35) - 5
   \]
2. In **computer notation**, multiplication is represented by **`*`**.  
   So in Python, we write:
   ```python
   print(2 * (45 + 35) - 5)
   ```
   Then press **Enter**.

**Note:**  
Without `print`, simply typing the formula also returns the result.  
However, **it is best practice to always use `print`** in program files! 🚀

## **17. Sample Task – Quotient, Remainder, Integer Division**

### **Task:**
Write a program that **extracts** the **ones place** and the **tens place** of the number **35**!

### **Solution:**
1. **Extracting the ones place**  
   - The **ones digit** of **35** is **5**.  
   - We get this by computing **the remainder** when dividing **35 by 10**.
   - The **modulus operator** (`%`) gives the remainder.  
   - Enter the following command in Python and press **Enter**:
     ```python
     print(35 % 10)
     ```
2. **The result (5) appears in blue text** in the command interpreter.

3. **Extracting the tens place**  
   - The **tens digit** of **35** is **3**.
   - We get this by performing **integer division** of **35 by 10**.
   - The **division operator** (`/`) gives the quotient **including decimals**.
   - Enter the following command:
     ```python
     print(35 / 10)
     ```

4. **The result (3.5) appears**.  
   - This is **not an integer**, because **Python performs floating-point division** by default.

5. **To get an integer result**, use the `int` function:
   ```python
   print(int(35 / 10))
   ```
   - The correct answer (3) appears.

### **Additional Notes:**
- In Python, **decimal fractions** are written with **dots** (e.g., `3.5`, not `3,5`).
- The `int()` function **rounds down** by **removing the decimal part**, rather than rounding normally.

---

This task introduces basic mathematical operators in Python:
- **`%`** → Remainder (modulus)
- **`/`** → Division (returns a floating-point result)
- **`int()`** → Converts to an integer (truncates decimal part)

🚀 Now you know how to break down a number into its digits using Python!

## **3. VARIABLES**

When using a calculator, we often store intermediate results in memory, so we can recall them when needed. Variables in programming languages serve the same purpose. However, since there are multiple variables, we use them differently.

A variable (with some limitations) can be given any name, and we assign it a value. Think of it as a labeled drawer in a cabinet: we name it (labeling) and place the value we want to store inside.

---

## **18. Sample Task – Using Variables**

Calculate the **perimeter** and **area** of a rectangular plot that is **35 meters long** and **25 meters wide**, while storing the **side lengths**, **perimeter**, and **area** in variables.

### **Steps:**
1. Assign **35** to the variable **a**.  
   - Enter the following command:
     ```python
     a = 35
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

2. Assign **25** to the variable **b**.  
   - Enter:
     ```python
     b = 25
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

3. Compute the **perimeter** using the formula `k = 2 * (a + b)`.  
   - Enter:
     ```python
     k = 2 * (a + b)
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

4. Compute the **area** using the formula `t = a * b`.  
   - Enter:
     ```python
     t = a * b
     ```
   - Press **Enter**.

5. Print the **perimeter**:
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```
   - The output **(120)** appears.

6. Print the **area**:
   ```python
   print(t)
   ```
   - The output **(875)** appears.

7. Increase the value of **a** by **5**:  
   ```python
   a = a + 5
   ```
   - Press **Enter**.

8. Verify the new value of **a**:  
   ```python
   print(a)
   ```
   - The output is **40**, confirming the change.

---

### **Concepts Introduced:**
- **Assigning values to variables**
- **Using variables in formulas**
- **Printing variable values**
- **Updating a variable’s value**

🚀 Now you can calculate and store values efficiently in Python!

----
Here is the full English translation of the text:

---

At first, `a = a + 5` may seem strange since it is mathematically meaningless. A number cannot be equal to itself plus five. However, in Python, the `=` sign means **"assign"**, not "equals," and is not used for comparison (for that, we use `==`).  
Thus, `a = a + 5` should be read as:  
**"Assign to `a` the value of `a` increased by 5."**  
If `a` was previously **35**, this statement increases it by **5**, making it **40**.

---

### **12. In Python, there is a shorter way to increase a variable's value.**  
Increase the variable's value by **5** again, but this time using a shorter syntax:  
```python
a += 5
```
Press **Enter**.

---

### **13. Verify the new value of `a`. Print the value:**  
```python
print(a)
```
#### **14. The output displayed by the interpreter is: 45.**

---

### **15. Try the shorter syntax for decreasing a variable.**  
Reduce the value of **b** by **10** using:  
```python
b -= 10
```
Press **Enter**.

---

### **16. Verify the new value of `b`. Print the value:**  
```python
print(b)
```
#### **17. The output displayed by the interpreter is: 15.**

---

### **18. Multiple statements can be written in one line.**  
In Python, multiple commands can be written in a **single line** if separated by **commas**.  
Similarly, we can print multiple values in one line by **separating them with commas**.  

Use this technique to complete the task based on the right-side example.

---

### **Concepts Covered:**
- **Variable assignment**
- **Updating values using `+=` and `-=`**
- **Printing multiple values in a single line**
- **Using commas for separating commands**

🚀 You are now handling Python variables like a pro!

----
Here is the full English translation of the text:

---

### **Overview**  
**A variable is a reserved piece of memory that can be referenced by its name.**

#### **Rules for Naming Variables:**
- A variable name **must start with a letter** from the English alphabet.
- It **may contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`)**.
- It **cannot match any reserved keywords or commands** in Python.

---

### **Assigning Values to Variables**
The most important operation performed on a variable is **assignment**.  
The **left side** of an assignment holds the **variable name**, and the **right side** holds the **value** assigned to it.  
For example:  
```python
b = 25
```
This is read as: **"Let `b` be 25."**

Multiple variables can be assigned values in one statement, separated by commas:  
```python
a, b, c = 3, 4, 5
```

---

### **How Variables Work in Python**
When a variable is **first used**, Python **allocates memory** for it,  
**links the name to the value**, and **determines the variable’s type**.  

The type is determined **automatically**, which is necessary because **different types of data** are stored in different ways in memory.  

Python has several **data types**:
- **String (`str`)** → A sequence of characters (also called a **text string**).
- **Integer (`int`)** → Whole numbers (e.g., 3, -7, 42).
- **Floating-point (`float`)** → Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.718).
- **Boolean (`bool`)** → Logical values **True** or **False**.

---

### **Updating Variable Values**
For numeric variables, we can use shortcut operations like:
```python
a += 5  # Increases 'a' by 5
b -= 2  # Decreases 'b' by 2
c *= 3  # Multiplies 'c' by 3
```

---

### **Strongly-Typed vs. Weakly-Typed Languages**
In many programming languages like **C++, C#, or Pascal**, variables must be **explicitly declared** before use.  
These languages are called **strongly-typed languages**.  
In contrast, **Python and Basic** automatically determine types, so they are considered **weakly-typed languages**.

🚀 **With this knowledge, you can now efficiently use variables in Python!**



----

## **4. PROGRAM**  

### **Overview**  
It would be useful to avoid retyping commonly used sequences of commands repeatedly. Instead, we can **store them in a file**, retrieve them when needed, and execute them with a single button press.  
For example, a program could calculate the **perimeter and area** of a rectangle.  

The **building blocks of a program** are called **commands**.  
For instance, the command:  
```python
print(3 * 5)
```  
when entered in the Python interpreter and executed by pressing **Enter**, immediately runs as a **command**.  
However, **if the command is saved in a file, it becomes part of a program**.

> **A program is a sequence of commands arranged in a meaningful order to solve a problem.**  
> The execution of these commands is called **running the program**.

---

### **Rules for Writing Programs in Python**
- In Python, **each command is separated by the end of a line** (pressing **Enter**).  
  - Every command must start **on a new line**, and at the end of the line, you **must press Enter**.
  
- **Long commands can be split across multiple lines** for readability.  
  - The **backslash (`\`)** is used to indicate that a command **continues on the next line**.
  
- **Indentation matters** at the beginning of a line.
  - Python uses **leading spaces (indentation) to structure the code**, so it is **important to start each command at the correct position**.

---

### **19. Example Task – Writing, Saving, Running, and Opening a Program**  
Let's create a program that calculates the **perimeter and area** of a **rectangle** with side lengths **35 meters and 25 meters**.

#### **Steps:**
1. In the **Python Shell window** (where we've been working so far), click on **File → New File**.
2. A new blank window will open.  
   - This is called the **editor window**.
   - From now on, we will work in this editor.
   - We will **type, modify, run, and save** our program here.

### 5. DATA INPUT

It would be beneficial if certain parts of our programs' data, such as the sides of a rectangle, could be provided by the user without needing to edit the program itself. Data input commands serve this purpose.

---

### 20. Sample Task – Text-Type Data Input, Quick Saving

Request the user’s name and then greet them with the following text:  
**"Welcome, ..."**  
where **...** is the user's name. (Quotation marks should not be included in the output.)

1. Open a new program (**File/New File**).
2. Use the **input** command for data input. Place parentheses after the command. Inside the parentheses, enclosed in quotation marks, we specify what to ask from the user.
3. Assign the value received from the **input** command to a variable to store the entered data. In this case, we use **n** as the variable.
4. The output will be familiar. In the **print** command, separate the displayed text and the variable using a comma within the parentheses.
5. Type the program as shown in the example and save it as **feladatIII_05_1.py** (**File/Save As…**).
6. Run the program (**F5**).
7. In the **Python Shell** window, the prompt **"Please enter your name:"** will appear, with a blinking cursor. Enter a name and press the **Enter** key. This will always be the way to input data in the command-line interpreter.
8. Python will display the message **"Welcome, …"**.

---
 
 
---

### **Type Conversion, Conversion**

We have seen that there are different data types. The **input** command reads characters as input. However, character strings cannot be multiplied or added as numbers. Therefore, a value of type **string** must be converted into an **integer** or **floating-point number**.  
To convert a string into an **integer**, we use the **int** command, and for a floating-point number, we use the **float** command.

---

### **21. Sample Task – Data Type Conversion (String to Integer)**

Modify the program that calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle so that the user can enter the rectangle’s sides while the program is running.

1. Load the already created **feladatIII_04** program (**File/Open...**).
2. Save it under a new name so we don’t accidentally overwrite the previous one (**File/Save As…**, **Filename: feladatIII_05_2**).
3. The issue is that simply writing:  
   **b = input("Please enter the second side: ")**  
   would not work. This is because the **input** command **always reads input as a string**, so Python would consider **b** as a string. Strings cannot be multiplied or added like numbers.  
   To fix this, we need to **convert the string input into an integer** using **type conversion (type casting)**. The correct way to write it is:  
   **b = int(input("Please enter the second side: "))**.
4. Modify the first two lines accordingly, as shown in the figure.
5. Save the program (**Ctrl + S** for keyboard users, or **File/Save** in the menu).
6. Run the program (**F5**).
7. In the **Python Shell** window, enter the rectangle’s sides as prompted, pressing **Enter** after each.
8. The output should resemble the provided example.

---

 Here is the translated text from Hungarian to English:

---

### **9. Modify the first two lines so that instead of `int`, we use `float`, allowing us to enter decimal numbers as well.**  
### **10. Save the file. Press `Ctrl+S`, and the editor will save the file.**  
### **11. Run the program (`F5`).**  
### **12. In the Python Shell window, enter the rectangle’s sides, pressing `Enter` after each. Use values `3.5` and `2.5`, with a decimal point. (The result will be `12.0` and `8.75`.)**  

---

## **6. FORMATTED OUTPUT**

### **Indented Output**  

The **print** command works in such a way that it places spaces between arguments separated by commas and starts a new line at the end of the output. However, these are just default settings, which we may occasionally need to change. Although the following example could be solved differently, let's expand our knowledge a bit to avoid formatting issues in the future.

---

### **22. Sample Task – Indented Output**  

Modify the previous program so that the result is displayed as shown in the attached image. Use separate **print** statements for `"The perimeter of the rectangle:"` and `120`, while another **print** statement should output `"The area of the rectangle:"` and `875`.

1. Open the **feladatIII_05_2** program (**File/Open...**).
2. Save it as **feladatIII_06_1** (**File/Save As...**, **Filename: feladatIII_06_1**).

---

 Here is the translated text from Hungarian to English:

---

### **3. Modify only the end of the program in the `print` statements.**  
Within the parentheses of the **print** command, you can set how the line ends using the **`end`** parameter. **`end = ' '`** means that the line should end with a space (instead of a new line).  
Thus, the correct `print` statement is:  
```python
print("The perimeter of the rectangle:", end=" ")
```

### **4. The last item to be displayed should also be printed using a separate `print` command, but instead of spaces, we want a new line as a separator.**  
The parameter used for separators is called **`sep`**, and it works similarly to **`end`**.  
- **`sep='\n'`** means that elements separated by commas should be printed on new lines.  
Thus, the correct `print` statement is:  
```python
print("The area of the rectangle:", t, sep="\n")
```

### **5. Make the necessary modifications as shown in the illustration.**  
### **6. Save the program (`Ctrl+S`).**  
### **7. Run the program and test it (`F5`).**  

---

## **Using Markers (Placeholders)**  

For more complex formatted data output, **markers (placeholders)** can be useful.  
- **Markers begin with a percent sign (%)**, can be embedded in text, and their values are provided later in the `print` statement.  
- Typically, **`%s`** is used to replace strings, while **`%d`** is for integers and **`%f`** for floating-point numbers.

---

### **23. Sample Task – Using Markers**  

Request two **fractions** from the user and display their multiplication without simplification, formatted as follows:  
**25/12 * 7/3 = 175/36**

1. Open a new program in the editor (**File/New File**).  
2. Request the numerators and denominators of the fractions using the **input** command, as done previously.
