#### **1. General Structure of a Program**

A computer program consists of three main components:  
1. **Data Structure**  
2. **Business Logic**  
3. **User Interface**  

For simple scripts, these elements may blend together, but in large-scale software, they are clearly separated.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structure**
- Programs **store and manage data**, whether permanent or temporary.
- Various **data structures** include:
  - **Variables** ‚Äì Store simple values.
  - **Files** ‚Äì Store structured data.
  - **Databases** ‚Äì Manage large datasets.
- The **choice of data structure** affects efficiency and functionality.
- Well-structured data organization **improves performance and maintainability**.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic (Application Logic)**
- The **core functionality** of the program.
- Defines **what the program does**.
- Can range from **simple operations** to **complex rule-based systems**.
- Often **separated from the user interface** to keep functionality independent.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ User Interface (UI)**
- **Where users interact** with the program.
- Displays **messages, results, and input fields**.
- UI can be:
  - **Command-line based (CLI)**
  - **Graphical (GUI)**
  - **Web-based**
- Good UI design emphasizes **clarity and usability**.

### **Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Data Structures** ‚Äì Efficient storage and management.  
‚úÖ **Business Logic** ‚Äì Defines how the program operates.  
‚úÖ **User Interface** ‚Äì Enables interaction with the program.  

A well-structured program **separates these three components**, making it **easier to develop, maintain, and scale**! üöÄ
