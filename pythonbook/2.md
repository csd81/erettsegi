### **II. Fundamentals of Programming**  
#### **1. General Structure of a Program**

A computer program consists of three main components:  
1. **Data Structure**  
2. **Business Logic**  
3. **User Interface**  

For simple scripts, these elements may blend together, but in large-scale software, they are clearly separated.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Structure**
- Programs **store and manage data**, whether permanent or temporary.
- Various **data structures** include:
  - **Variables** ‚Äì Store simple values.
  - **Files** ‚Äì Store structured data.
  - **Databases** ‚Äì Manage large datasets.
- The **choice of data structure** affects efficiency and functionality.
- Well-structured data organization **improves performance and maintainability**.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic (Application Logic)**
- The **core functionality** of the program.
- Defines **what the program does**.
- Can range from **simple operations** to **complex rule-based systems**.
- Often **separated from the user interface** to keep functionality independent.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ User Interface (UI)**
- **Where users interact** with the program.
- Displays **messages, results, and input fields**.
- UI can be:
  - **Command-line based (CLI)**
  - **Graphical (GUI)**
  - **Web-based**
- Good UI design emphasizes **clarity and usability**.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
‚úÖ **Data Structures** ‚Äì Efficient storage and management.  
‚úÖ **Business Logic** ‚Äì Defines how the program operates.  
‚úÖ **User Interface** ‚Äì Enables interaction with the program.  

A well-structured program **separates these three components**, making it **easier to develop, maintain, and scale**! üöÄ

### **Console Applications & Algorithms**

#### **Console Applications (Konzolalkalmaz√°sok)**
- Programs that only display **text-based output**.
- Used in **basic programming education** and **automation scripts**.
- **High school programming exams** require console applications only.
- Useful for **testing basic programming techniques** before adding a GUI.
- **Web applications** focus heavily on UI, requiring more development effort.

---

## **2. ALGORITHMS**
### **Definition of an Algorithm**
- An **algorithm** is a **step-by-step sequence** of instructions for solving a problem.
- Examples include:
  - **Cooking recipes**
  - **Assembly instructions**
  - **Mathematical procedures (e.g., prime factorization)**

> **Algorithms describe logical steps**, much like saying: *"Break three eggs!"*

---

### **Algorithm Representation Methods**
- Algorithms are often written **independently of programming languages**.
- This has two advantages:
  1. **More readable and structured** ‚Äì Easier to understand and modify.
  2. **Can be implemented in different languages**.

Algorithms **serve as blueprints**, and their logic can be later translated into **specific programming languages**.

This section introduces **fundamental problem-solving techniques**, making programming **clearer and more structured**! üöÄ

-----

### **Algorithm Representation Methods**
Algorithms can be described in **various ways**, depending on the level of **formality and precision** required.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sentence-Based Description (Mondatos Le√≠r√°s)**
- The **simplest** form of algorithm representation.
- Uses **plain sentences** like a **recipe**.
- Example: *"Get two numbers, add them, display the result."*
- **Limitations**:
  - Not always precise enough.
  - Difficult to convert into code.
  - Not structured for computer execution.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Flowcharts (Folyamat√°bra)**
- A **graphical** way to **visualize an algorithm**.
- Uses **different shapes** for:
  - **Parallelogram** ‚Äì Input/output (`Be:` for input, `Ki:` for output).
  - **Rectangle** ‚Äì Process (e.g., calculations).
  - **Diamond** ‚Äì Decision-making (not shown in this example).
- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to **read and understand**.
  - Shows the **flow of execution** clearly.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Takes **more space**.
  - Not ideal for **very large algorithms**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Pseudocode (Pszeudok√≥d)**
- A **structured textual representation** of an algorithm.
- **Looks like programming code** but is **not tied to a specific language**.
- **Example**:
  ```pseudo
  START
  INPUT A
  INPUT B
  C = A + B
  OUTPUT C
  STOP
  ```
- **Benefits**:
  - More **formal** than sentence-based descriptions.
  - **Easier to convert into real code**.
  - **Better for larger algorithms**.

---

### **Algorithm Representation with Flowcharts**
The example shows a **simple addition program**:
1. **Start**
2. **Get input (A and B)**
3. **Calculate C = A + B**
4. **Display the result**
5. **Stop**

This teaches **basic flowchart elements** that later help in **programming logic and control structures**.

---

### **Key Learning Points**
‚úÖ **Sentence-based** ‚Äì Easy but **not precise**.  
‚úÖ **Flowcharts** ‚Äì Visual and structured.  
‚úÖ **Pseudocode** ‚Äì Best for **formal, structured algorithm design**.  

These methods **help plan algorithms** before coding, making programming **more structured and efficient**! üöÄ
