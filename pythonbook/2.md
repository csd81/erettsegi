#### **1. General Structure of a Program**

A computer program consists of three main components:  
1. **Data Structure**  
2. **Business Logic**  
3. **User Interface**  

For simple scripts, these elements may blend together, but in large-scale software, they are clearly separated.

---

### **1️⃣ Data Structure**
- Programs **store and manage data**, whether permanent or temporary.
- Various **data structures** include:
  - **Variables** – Store simple values.
  - **Files** – Store structured data.
  - **Databases** – Manage large datasets.
- The **choice of data structure** affects efficiency and functionality.
- Well-structured data organization **improves performance and maintainability**.

---

### **2️⃣ Business Logic (Application Logic)**
- The **core functionality** of the program.
- Defines **what the program does**.
- Can range from **simple operations** to **complex rule-based systems**.
- Often **separated from the user interface** to keep functionality independent.

---

### **3️⃣ User Interface (UI)**
- **Where users interact** with the program.
- Displays **messages, results, and input fields**.
- UI can be:
  - **Command-line based (CLI)**
  - **Graphical (GUI)**
  - **Web-based**
- Good UI design emphasizes **clarity and usability**.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
✅ **Data Structures** – Efficient storage and management.  
✅ **Business Logic** – Defines how the program operates.  
✅ **User Interface** – Enables interaction with the program.  

A well-structured program **separates these three components**, making it **easier to develop, maintain, and scale**! 🚀

### **Console Applications & Algorithms**

#### **Console Applications (Konzolalkalmazások)**
- Programs that only display **text-based output**.
- Used in **basic programming education** and **automation scripts**.
- **High school programming exams** require console applications only.
- Useful for **testing basic programming techniques** before adding a GUI.
- **Web applications** focus heavily on UI, requiring more development effort.

---

## **2. ALGORITHMS**
### **Definition of an Algorithm**
- An **algorithm** is a **step-by-step sequence** of instructions for solving a problem.
- Examples include:
  - **Cooking recipes**
  - **Assembly instructions**
  - **Mathematical procedures (e.g., prime factorization)**

> **Algorithms describe logical steps**, much like saying: *"Break three eggs!"*

---

### **Algorithm Representation Methods**
- Algorithms are often written **independently of programming languages**.
- This has two advantages:
  1. **More readable and structured** – Easier to understand and modify.
  2. **Can be implemented in different languages**.

Algorithms **serve as blueprints**, and their logic can be later translated into **specific programming languages**.

This section introduces **fundamental problem-solving techniques**, making programming **clearer and more structured**! 🚀
