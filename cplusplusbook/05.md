### V. PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS

Procedures and functions are subprograms (also called subroutines). With their help, we can divide our programs into smaller parts, making them modular. We write the subprogram and then refer to it by name. In the main program, we only call the subprogram by its name.

One of the main advantages of using procedures and functions is the avoidance of code repetition. The program becomes shorter, more transparent, and it is enough to change the subprogram if there is a code error or if we want it to work differently in the future. Another advantage is that a larger program, broken into smaller parts, can be solved by multiple people working as a team.

The use of procedures and functions changes the basic sequence of instruction execution. In subprograms and the main program, the execution order remains sequential. Calling a subprogram, the program execution jumps to the first line of the subprogram. After the subprogram finishes, execution continues in the main program from the line after the call.

Look at the diagram on the right! There is a main program with several tasks. To improve readability, we separate the tasks on the screen with dashed lines (and a blank line). At the end of each task, we place a call to a procedure with a descriptive name. Think about whether placing this procedure will make your code shorter and clearer. If we decide that a procedure would fit well, we can place it at the end of the program. In case of multiple procedures, we can place them one after another. Itâ€™s a good practice to have at least three lines of content in each procedure. Additionally, if we want to reuse a task in multiple places, it's worth writing it as a procedure, making the program more concise and easier to maintain.
