## PREFACE

I primarily recommend this book to students preparing for the advanced-level high school graduation exam in computer science, as the knowledge and tasks primarily align with those requirements. However, with the supplementary topics (fundamentals of object-oriented programming, basics of Windows applications), it can also be useful for vocational training foundation subjects and for self-study.

I chose C++ and C# as the programming languages so that the acquired knowledge can also be used after graduation.  
I rewrote the programming exercises to be closer to the C language. Array indexing starts from zero, and I supplemented them with variations not found in standard collections of algorithms but that have appeared in final exams (e.g., custom sorting).  

The development of Windows applications is explained step by step with a simple example, guiding the reader through the process. I recommend it to everyone who wants to try software development in an entertaining way.  

Due to space constraints, the book contains only a few complete program codes. Additional programs related to the book can be downloaded as supplementary material from the publisher's website:

## 1. INTRODUCTION  

### GENERAL STRUCTURE OF A PROGRAM  

A computer program consists of the following parts: data structure, business logic, and user interface. Of course, in a short program with only a few lines, these parts are not very distinct. But with software consisting of a million lines, the situation is quite different.  

#### Data Structure  
The program needs to store the data it uses (whether permanent or temporary). To do this, we use various data structures (variables, files, databases). We choose the appropriate data structures according to the task. The foundation of every program is a well-chosen data structure, and special attention should be given to its design and consideration.  

#### Business Logic  
Sometimes business logic consists of only a few simple lines, while other times it is a complex, lengthy set of lines. This is also called the application logic. The business logic makes up the "soul" of the program. It defines what the program does. (This has nothing to do with commerce.)  

#### User Interface  
The program user interacts with the user interface. This is where the program’s messages, results, and questions are displayed. It can be a typical Windows-style interface, a web interface, or even just a text-only display. In all cases, it is important to ensure clarity and simplicity.  

---

### CONSOLE APPLICATIONS  

Programs that display only text are called **console applications**.  
At the graduation exam, it is expected that all requested and displayed data be accompanied by textual explanations. One must be able to write console applications for the exam.  

The significance of console applications is that they are the simplest way to practice and learn new software techniques. Sometimes, for technical or financial reasons, a graphical interface is not feasible or necessary.  

In web development, the appearance is especially important, and developing a user interface requires significant human resources, often involving web designers.

## ALGORITHMS  

### The Concept of an Algorithm  

When given a task, solving it involves a series of steps. Whether it’s cooking a dish or adding two numbers (by hand or with a calculator), the solution consists of steps that follow each other.  

**We call an algorithm the sequence of steps suitable for solving a task.**  

Examples of algorithms include cooking recipes, step-by-step assembly instructions, descriptions of chemical experiments, and methods for prime factorization.  

The steps are often expressed as instructions (e.g., “Break three eggs!”). While we may soften our language for politeness in conversation, algorithms use clear, direct commands.  

---

### Tools for Describing Algorithms  

Algorithms are typically described in ways that are independent of programming languages. This has two advantages:  
1. The description is shorter and clearer.  
2. Everyone can understand it, even without knowing programming languages.  

- **The most commonly used format is the sentence-based description**, similar to how recipes are written.  
- **Flowcharts** can also be used to visually present shorter algorithms. The steps are represented by different shapes, and arrows indicate their sequence. This is a clear and easily understandable method. However, for large algorithms, such graphical representation becomes problematic.  
- Another method is **pseudo-code**, where the building blocks are predetermined and standardized.  

---

### Providing an Algorithm with a Flowchart  

Let’s take a simple task: ask the user for two numbers, add them, and display the result.  
- **Parallelograms** indicate input/output,  
- **Rectangles** indicate execution steps,  
- Flowcharts always begin with **START** and end with **STOP**.  

---

### Providing an Algorithm with Sentence-Based Description  

The steps are written down in sequence.  
Example for an addition program:  
```
Input: a  
Input: b  
c := a + b  
Output: c
```  
There are other agreed-upon sentence-based descriptions, which will be introduced later under control structures.  

---

## ALGORITHMIZATION  

Creating the algorithm is called algorithmization.  
Sometimes, the necessary steps are immediately clear. Other times, we have to think long and apply various techniques. It may also happen that the problem has no solution.  

A task can be easily algorithmized if it can be related to previously known formulas, types of algorithms, or methods.

## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES  

### Machine Code  

Initially, computers were programmed directly in machine code. The bytes of the program were entered into the computer one by one.  

The attached image shows a machine code program in the memory of a Commodore Plus 4 computer, starting at memory location **2000**.  

Each two-digit hexadecimal number (e.g., A9) represents one byte.  
The image shows the Neumann principle: instructions and data are stored together in memory. For example, A9 is an instruction, 02 is data (in this case, the code for the color dark red), and so on.  

Writing programs in machine code was tedious and required great expertise. One had to understand how the computer’s internals worked, down to how the processor “thinks.”  

Today, computers only execute machine code programs. Under Windows, we encounter them with the **exe** extension. Such programs are commonly called **binaries**.

### **Page 13**

**Assembly**

The appearance of assembly made things somewhat easier, where the still short machine code instructions were replaced by characteristic names. In the image, next to the machine code, the assembly instruction also appears: for example, the A9 instruction corresponds to LDA (Load Accumulator), and 8D corresponds to STA (Store the Accumulator).

Originally, programs developed in machine code or assembly occupy little space and run very fast. However, developing them is difficult, requires great expertise, and is extremely slow and expensive. In the era of fast computers, machine code is only used for special purposes. This includes illegal modifications and hacking.

**High-level programming languages**

Assembly also turned out to not be an efficient enough tool. There was a need to express thoughts in a way closer to human thinking. This led to the creation of the predecessors of today’s programming languages, such as C, Pascal, and Basic. Programming in these languages is much easier than in machine code and requires a more human-like approach. The developer writes the program in C, which is called **source code**. The source code is then converted into machine code (binary) by a **C compiler**.

Programs compiled into binary code will never be as small and fast as those written directly in machine code because compilers add unnecessary overhead. Over time, compilers have become increasingly advanced, but perfection has never been achieved. The choice remains between small and fast or cheap and wasteful. The accelerated business world tends to favor the latter. Increasingly faster and higher-capacity machines help with this.

Programming languages that are closer to human thinking are called **high-level languages**, and machine code or assembly are referred to as **low-level languages**. 

Writing a few hundred lines of simple programs is sufficient using high-level languages and structured programming (for example, for microcontroller programs or smaller web scripts). No more is expected at the graduation exam level.

### **Page 14**

**Object-oriented programming**

Over time, the size and complexity of software demanded by the market increased to the point that traditional high-level, structured programming could no longer produce solutions that were fast, economical, and extendable enough. Therefore, a new method had to be developed: object-oriented programming.

Object-oriented programming extended already existing high-level languages (C, Pascal, Basic). This resulted in the creation of C++, C#, Java, Object Pascal, Delphi, and others.

Object-oriented source code is compiled into binary executable code by compilers. Programs developed this way are larger and slower than those created by traditional structured programming (see Windows).

**Graphical development environments**

The market demands even faster and more efficient development with increasingly complex programs. To achieve this, graphical development environments are created, allowing developers to build programs with minimal coding.

The book introduces Visual Studio, where buttons, menus, and other necessary elements for Windows applications can be dragged onto windows with the mouse. The environment generates the code for us. The program sections corresponding to events (e.g., clicking) can still be written manually. There are also development environments where control structures (e.g., loops) can be added and configured graphically.

In general, the more convenient a development environment is, the more space it takes, and the larger and slower the program compiled from it will be. The more automatic and convenient the environment, the less flexible it is and the less it supports unique and individual solutions. Often, parts of the code cannot be accessed manually and can only be generated by the development environment.

**Development environments for business and free use**

Free development environments are usually less sophisticated, offer fewer features, and are harder to handle compared to their commercial counterparts. The book mentions Code::Blocks, which only supports writing code and cannot embed Windows application elements.

With business development environments, work can proceed quickly. You only need to design parts of the code; the environment generates the rest based on the plan. Their biggest drawback is the high price, but for a well-performing software developer company, the investment quickly pays off due to fewer man-hours.

A common trick used for educational purposes is “baiting” by offering a free development environment. Many of my acquaintances have fallen for this: they learned programming in such an environment, only to later realize that creating sellable software required the commercial version. The company couldn't afford the price as a small business, so they had to rewrite their program in a free environment over the next three years.

Another environment discussed in the book is Visual Studio Express, an excellent example for educational use. It's free for learning purposes but not for commercial software development. For commercial development, one should buy the Visual Studio Professional (or Enterprise) version or use the free, but more limited, Visual Studio Community edition.

**Errors**

Wherever humans work, errors can occur, disrupting or making the program's operation impossible. These errors can be syntactic or semantic.

**Syntactic errors**

Syntactic, or formal errors, are **language errors that prevent the compiler from accepting the code**. Causes include:
- Typographical errors: missing or incorrect letters in commands.
- Missing required semicolons at the end of statements.
- Unmatched opening or closing brackets.

Syntactic errors are generally easy to find by carefully reviewing the code. Development environments help by showing where the error occurred during compilation. Often the error message points to the location and nature of the error.

---

### **Page 16**

**Semantic error**

Semantic, or content errors, occur when **the program compiles but does not do what we expect from it**. It might crash, give incorrect results, or stop due to illegal operations (runtime error).

Semantic errors are harder to find than syntactic errors. They are uncovered through thorough **testing**. Some appear during development testing, but some may only surface years later as hidden bugs.

**Development = coding + immediate testing**

Developing a program involves writing code line by line and, in the best case, testing the program after each part is completed and fixing any errors. The best possible test is to ensure the program compiles without errors and runs as expected.

Testing is a time-consuming process. Everyone would like to spend as little time as possible on it, since the client doesn’t pay for it, and exams don't award points for it. Still, it’s better to test frequently than write large portions at once and only then test, which can lead to difficult-to-find errors.

Beginners should test after every two lines of code! If instructions have many parameters, test every two parameters. Later, instincts will develop, and the ratio between immediate testing and coding will adjust to the appropriate level. Some parts will require more frequent testing, others less.

### **Data Streams**

From the central part of the computer to the peripherals (for example, the monitor or storage devices), bytes arrive in the correct order, one after another, as data streams. In technical terminology, these data streams are called **streams**. For example, in a console window, characters appear in the order they are written, from left to right.

**(Illustration: stream from the computer to the monitor with reversed text turning into “Hello World!”)**

Every data stream has a memory area where bytes can temporarily wait. This is necessary because data can reach the central part so quickly that the peripheral may not be able to receive it immediately. This temporary waiting area is called a **buffer**, and the process of utilizing it is called **buffering**.

Buffering is important because if we interrupt the data stream too early, data loss can occur, as the data stored in the buffer may not reach its destination (such as the storage device).

From the peripheral side toward the central part of the computer (like from a keyboard or storage), we also use data streams that have buffer areas in memory.

Here is the full English translation of the five pages you provided:

## Page 1 (original page 18)

**HELLO WORLD**

Traditionally, when learning a new programming language, we begin by displaying the text "Hello World!" on the screen.

### C#

1. Open Visual Studio Express.
2. In Visual Studio, we write programs within the framework of a project.  
   Therefore, let's start a new project using the **File/New Project** menu option.
3. In the left panel, select the programming language:  
   **Installed/Templates/Visual C#**.
4. In the middle panel, choose the console application:  
   **Console Application**.
5. In the lower panel of the window, specify the project name:  
   **Name: hellovilag**.
6. Specify the folder where you would like the project files to be saved, e.g.,  
   **Location: D:\works\**.

---

## Page 2 (original page 19)

7. Click the **OK** button. After a short wait, Visual Studio will prepare the file system for the project, and the code editor will appear where you can write your program.
8. We will write our programs inside a block that starts with `static void Main`. Find this block and press **Enter** while standing between the curly braces. The cursor will blink inside the braces.
9. To display text on the console screen, use the **Console.WriteLine** command. In parentheses and quotation marks, enter the text you wish to display.  
   *Type it exactly, paying attention to case sensitivity:*  
   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
   ```
10. If we run the program now, the console window would appear for a moment, display the text, and then close immediately. It would happen so fast that we would only see a blink. Let's add another command that keeps the console window open until we press Enter.  
   *Type it exactly, paying attention to case sensitivity:*  
   ```csharp
   Console.ReadLine();
   ```
11. The finished program can now be compiled into machine code and executed. Both steps can be performed at once in the development environment:  
   *Click the Start button.*  
   As a result, a black background window will appear with white characters showing "Hello World!".
12. If the program doesn't work, look for errors. The development environment helps by underlining errors and showing details in the **Error List** window below, including the probable cause (in the **Description** field) and the line number (**Line**). After fixing the error, restart the program.

---

## Page 3 (original page 20)

### C++

1. Open **Code::Blocks**.
2. Start creating a new C++ file using the **File/New/File** menu option.
3. In the upper right panel, select the appropriate category: **C/C++ source**, and click the **Go** button.
4. In the next window, select the programming language from the list on the right: **C++**, then click **Next**.
5. In the next window, click the icon next to the **Filename with full path** field. A file browser window will appear, as is typical in Windows applications.
6. Navigate to the desired folder where the C++ file should be saved (e.g., **D:\works\**).
7. In the **Filename** field, type the file name: **hellovilag**.
8. Complete the file creation by clicking the **Finish** button. The workspace will appear, and you can begin typing your program.
9. In C++, available commands are organized into function libraries. We need to indicate at the beginning of the code which libraries we want to use. To print text to the console, we need the **iostream** library.  
   *Type it exactly, paying attention to case sensitivity:*  
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   ```
10. For easier typing (fewer characters to type), it's good to set the default namespace:  
   *Type it exactly, paying attention to case sensitivity:*  
   ```cpp
   using namespace std;
   ```
11. Now let's create the main program block, where our commands will go.  
   *Type it exactly, paying attention to case sensitivity:*  
   ```cpp
   int main() {
   }
   ```
12. The command to print text to the console will go between the curly braces. Stand between the braces and press **Enter** to open a new line.

---

## Page 4 (original page 21)

13. If we want to display accented Hungarian characters correctly in the console window, we must set the console language to Hungarian.  
   *Type it exactly, paying attention to case sensitivity:*  
   ```cpp
   setlocale(LC_ALL, "hun");
   ```
14. Press **Enter** to move to a new line.
15. We can use the **cout** (Console OUTput) command to display text in the console. The **endl** keyword moves the output to a new line.  
   *Type it exactly, paying attention to case sensitivity:*  
   ```cpp
   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
   ```
16. The finished program can now be compiled into machine code and run. Both steps can be performed at once in the development environment:  
   *Click the Build and Run icon in the menu bar.*  
   As a result, a black background window will appear with white characters showing the text "Hello World!".
17. If the program doesn't work, look for errors. The development environment will highlight the probable line of the error with a red marker, and the **Build messages** window below will show the likely cause (in the **Message** field) and the line number (**Line**). After fixing the error, restart the program.

### FREQUENT QUESTIONS

**Line numbers are not visible in C#. How can I turn them on?**  
Go to the **Tools/Options** menu, select the **Text Editor/C#** category, then in the **Display** panel, check **Line numbers**.

---

**I want to transfer a program under development to another computer. What do I need to copy?**  
- **C#:** Copy the entire project directory, including subdirectories and files.  
  Example: `d:\works\hellovilag\`  
- **C++:** Copy the `.cpp` file.  
  Example: `D:\works\hellovilag.cpp`

---

**I want to run the finished program without a development environment. How do I deploy it?**  
- **C#:** The compiled program is located in a folder with the project name, under `hellovilag\bin\Debug` (e.g., `hellovilag.exe`). Copy this file to another folder, drive, or machine. The `.exe` file created by Visual Studio will work. If it was built with Visual Studio Express, it is not suitable for commercial distribution.  
  Example: `d:\works\hellovilag\hellovilag\bin\Debug\`
- **C++:** The compiled program is located where you created the `.cpp` file. Copy the file to another folder, drive, or machine — it will work without Code::Blocks.  
  Example: `d:\works\`

---

**Small windows with instructions pop up while typing. What are they for, and how do I use them?**  
This is a convenience feature of the development environment called **auto-completion**. After typing a few characters, a list appears from which you can choose using the arrow keys. The selected instruction can be inserted into the code by pressing the **Tab** key. If you can't remember the full instruction, this feature helps by suggesting possible completions.

### NOTES IN THE PROGRAM

#### Concept
Notes are sections in the code that the compiler does not attempt to execute. They only exist in the source file.  
Notes are also called comments. The act of adding notes to the code is called commenting.  

We use comments as reminders for ourselves, for example, about what a certain piece of code is for. If we do not touch a program for a year and then need to modify it (extend or fix it), we are unlikely to remember what we coded and why.  

Programs are often developed by multiple people. The code we write should be understandable to others as well. A comment can contain explanatory text, thus increasing the readability of the code.  

Comments can also be practical for testing. If we want to temporarily disable a line of code, we can comment it out. The program will still run without that line, and we can check for errors by looking at the commented-out section.  

#### Creation
We can create a comment by placing `/*` at the beginning and `*/` at the end (examples 1-3).  
A line following `//` will be a comment until the end of that line (examples 6 and 8).

**C# version:**
```
1)  /* Hello World!
2)  2018.04.01.
3)    */
4)  static void Main(string[] args)
5)  {
6)  //main program
7)      Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
8)      Console.ReadLine(); //waiting for Enter key
9)  }
```

**C++ version:**
```
1)  /* Hello World!
2)  Created: 2018.04.01.
3)  Created by:   */
4)  #include <iostream>
5)  using namespace std;
6)  //main program
7)  int main()
8)  {
9)      setlocale(LC_ALL,"hun"); //accented characters
10)     cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
11) }
```

---

### Tasks

1. Create and run a program named `hellovilag`.
2. Expand the previous program by displaying your own name below "Hello World!".
3. Introduce an error in the program and try to compile it. Check the development environment's feedback on the error: the underline in the code and the error message window below.
4. Extend the previous program with multi-line and single-line comments explaining what each command does.
5. Expand the program with a multi-line header comment at the beginning of the program where you write your name, the current date, and lines describing the software and hardware conditions (machine type, operating system, development environment).

### SUMMARY

The steps of program development are as follows:

1. **Thorough study of the task and assessing client requirements.**
2. **Planning:** In the case of a simpler program (such as a high school exam), this can be done in your head. For more complex programs, plans are documented with the help of supportive programs.
   - a) Decide what **data structures** to use.
   - b) Note down which **algorithms**, formulas, programming elements (see Chapter VI), or unique solutions will be applied. These notes can be made as comments or on paper.
3. **Coding** in the chosen programming language. During coding, perform **basic tests and error fixes**. This helps eliminate syntactic and simple semantic errors. The result is a working program whose correct operation is verified.
4. **Basic testing and error correction** continue to remove deeply embedded semantic errors (bugs).
5. **Documenting the program** from planning to testing.  
6. After completion, **deliver the finished program** and, if needed, install it on the client's computer.
7. Later, clients may request enhancements or new functions, requiring **updates**. If an error is found afterward, it may be necessary to replace the program on the client's computer with an updated version, i.e., **refresh** it.

The most critical part, according to experience, is continuous communication with clients. Even a year-long development can fail if there is no communication, causing the client to lose trust. Client requirements change constantly. The previously mentioned steps can slip and repeat.  

In large software companies, handling client communication is often a separate job. However, in typical software development, only about 20% is spent on coding, 40% on planning, and 40% on the most time-consuming part — testing.
