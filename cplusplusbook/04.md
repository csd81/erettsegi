## IV. HANDLING TEXT FILES

When we talk about handling text files, we mean reading their content into a program or modifying them through a program. The significance of these operations lies in the fact that in IT we very often use simple text files. This is how we typically store logs, and often parameters that influence the operation of programs and services.

Before starting programming, it's worth examining the text file: how much and what type of data is found in each line, how the data is separated (by spaces, delimiters, etc.), and so on. (We can view the content of simple text files with Notepad, or edit them in the simplest way.)  
The content of the example `adat.txt` file is as follows:

```
...
25 30 10 20 +
4 15 27 20 +
8 20 8 30 *
...
```

The delimiter is a space, and in each line four integers are followed by a single-character operation symbol.

The keyword in file handling is the stream. A stream refers to a reserved area in memory through which a text file can be accessed. The stream functions as a kind of buffer. For example, data coming from storage in bursts and quickly cannot be processed by the program at the required speed, so these data need to wait somewhere temporarily. The same situation occurs when writing to a file. The direction of the arrows in the figure is reversed in that case. The direction of the arrows is important from our perspective because if we terminate a stream too early, the data that hasn't yet reached the destination can be lost.

The diagram shows this process:

```

**The most common operations in file handling are the following:**

1. Opening a file (where, what, and for what purpose)  
2. Reading a line from a file, writing to a file  
3. Closing a file  

Creating a stream and opening a file happen simultaneously. We specify the file's name and its access path (the drive and the directory where the file is located), as well as the purpose of opening the file. The purpose could be reading, writing, or possibly appending. Don't forget to copy the text file to the appropriate directory!

The next step is to perform the desired file operations, i.e., reading or writing data from or to the file.  

Finally, after use, the file must be closed to avoid potential file damage.

---

## READING A LINE FROM A FILE

### C++

In the case of C++, variables and instructions necessary for filestream handling can be found in the `fstream` library, so this must be included at the beginning of the program (1).

The next step is the declaration of the stream (2). Consider the `fstream` keyword as a data type. After the type, we need to name the stream. In this example, the name is `be`.

The parameters can be found in parentheses.

We also need to specify the path and location of the file to be opened. If we don't specify a path (see example), the text file must be in the same directory as the program. If the text file is located in a different directory, we must specify the path. Directory separators should be written as `\\`.  

The second parameter (`ios::in`) shows that the file is opened for reading.  

We do not directly belong to the file handling part; rather, we need to bring in the necessary variables into which the read data will be placed (3–4).

The actual data input happens just like receiving data from the console. The only difference is that instead of using the `cin` keyword, we use the stream name (in this case `be`) (5). This method only works, of course, if the line of data matches the expected format.

**IV. HANDLING TEXT FILES**  

Data within a line is separated by spaces. (If this is not the case, you should proceed similarly to the C# example described later.)  

We then process the read data (6). In the example, this means formatted output: each line of the file contains numbers and an operator symbol, and we write a fractional operation to the screen.  

Finally, with the help of the `close()` function, we close the previously created stream (7).  

---

### **C#**  

In the case of C#, the variables and instructions required for handling a filestream are found in the `System.IO` namespace, so we must include this at the beginning of the program (1).  

We will need a variable of type `string` (line), where the currently read line from the file will be stored (2).  

If we do not want to handle the entire line at once, we need to split it into parts. These parts will be stored in an array of strings called `reszek` (parts) (3). We do not specify the size of the array in advance, it will be determined during splitting.  

The next step is the declaration of the filestream (4). The `StreamReader` keyword indicates that we are dealing with a data stream. After the type, we must give the name of the stream. In the example, it is: `be`.  

In parentheses, we specify the path and name of the file to be opened. If we do not specify a path (see the example), the text file must be in the same directory as the program file. This is:  

```
<program root>\ConsoleApplication1\bin\Debug
```

If the text file is located in another directory, we must specify the full path. The directories are separated by backslashes (`\`), which must be doubled (`\\`), or by writing `@` before the quoted string so that it remains a traditional Windows file path with single backslashes.  

**Examples:**  
```
"D:\\work\\distances.txt"
"S:\\data.txt"
@"S:\data.txt"
```  

The actual reading happens in such a way that the data will appear in the user interface. The only difference is that we will use the stream’s name (`be`) instead of the `Console` keyword (5).  

The read line could be directly displayed or written to the screen. However, the data found within the line must be processed and separated.  

---
 

#100



---



We will split along spaces. For this purpose, we use the `Split` function, where in parentheses we specify the delimiter, in this case the space character (6). The split strings will be placed in the array called `reszek` in the order they appear.  

**Image description:**  
- `adat.txt`  
```
...
25 30 10 20 +  
4 15 27 20 +  
8 20 8 30 *  
...
```
- Code:
```
sor = be.ReadLine()  
reszek = sor.Split(' ')
```
- Example:
```
sor = "25 30 10 20 +"  
reszek:  
0 -> 25  
1 -> 30  
2 -> 10  
3 -> 20  
4 -> +
```

The read data is then processed. (7) In this example, it means a formatted output: the numbers and operator signs found in each line of the file are written on the screen as fractional operations.  

Finally, using the `Close()` function, we close the previously created stream named `be` (8).  

---

### Tasks  

1. The file `kep.txt` contains pixel data in RGB code in each line. Write a program that reads the first line of `kep.txt` and displays it on the screen in the following form:  
   *red: 204, green: 37, blue: 8.*  

2. Write a program that displays the first line of the `adat.txt` file on the screen in the following form:  
   *24/32 + 8/3 =*  

3. Write a program that displays the first line of the `tavok.txt` file. Each line begins with the number corresponding to the day of the week (1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, etc.). The data in the file is in this format:  
   *1 7 14*, and they should appear on the screen in this form:  
   *Monday, 7th trip: 14 km.*

**IV. HANDLING TEXT FILES | 101**

### READING A KNOWN NUMBER OF DATA ROWS

If the number of rows in the file is known in advance, we just need to extend the basic program with a counting loop. Lines (5)-(6) must be repeated, that is, placed in the body of a loop.

How can we know in advance how many data rows to read? Sometimes this is indicated in the task description. For example: "Each row of the file contains one pixel's data in RGB code. The image is 50x50." So we can count on reading 2500 data rows (kep.txt).  
Other times, the number of rows to be read is given at the beginning of the file. (For example: in the file igeny.txt, in the third row.)

Example:
```
65  
25  
83  
9 3 14 3 10 17  
9 8 19 12 5 9  
9 9 29 7 10 19  
...
```
In this latter case, we first read a few lines without a loop into variables. Once we have reached the number of further data lines, we use a counting loop.

**Example algorithm:**  
1) Open file ("igeny.txt", for reading)  
2) Read from the file: number_of_levels  
3) Read from the file: number_of_teams  
4) Read from the file: number_of_requests  
5) Loop: i = 1 to number_of_requests  
6)    Read from the file: hour, minute, second, team_id, start_level, target_level  
7)    Display: hour, minute, second  
8) End loop  
9) Close file  

---

### Tasks  

1. The file kep.txt contains one pixel's data per line in RGB code. The image consists of 50x50 pixels. Write a program that reads the content of kep.txt and displays it on the screen in the following form:  
*red: 204, green: 37, blue: 8*  

2. The file igeny.txt contains lift usage requests.  
- The first line contains the number of levels,  
- the second line the number of teams,  
- the third line the number of requests.  
From the fourth line onward, each line contains a single request in the order of their appearance. Each request consists of six numbers:  
- The first three numbers represent the time (in hour, minute, second order),  
- the fourth number is the team number,  
- the fifth is the starting level,  
- the sixth is the target level.  
The numbers are separated by spaces. Write a program that reads the content of igeny.txt and displays the requests on the screen in the following format:  
*4. team - start: 2. level, arrives: 10. level, at 2 hours 36 minutes 47 seconds.*

**UNKNOWN NUMBER OF DATA ROWS READING**  

It often happens that we cannot know in advance how many lines are in a file because, for example, the file size changes. In this case, the previously known data reading must be done in the following way:  

### C++  

A conditional loop must be used in any case, as we cannot know how many times the read-in must be repeated. (6) The row reading should be performed until we reach the end of the file. The end of the file is checked by the `eof()` (end of file) function. Its value is true if we have reached the end of the file. In addition to this, the loop continuation condition must be specified. The loop should function as long as there is still data in the file, so the `eof()` function must be used with the negation (`!`) operator.  

Before reading in a row, we also need to make sure that the file is not empty or doesn't just contain empty lines (5). The previously read data needs to be processed (7), only after that can the next read-in follow (8).  

After writing the file reading routine, we should always test it thoroughly to ensure that both the first and last lines of the file are read and that neither of them is processed (displayed) twice.  

**Example in C++:**  
```
1)  #include <fstream>
2)  ifstream be("adat.txt", ios::in);
3)  int sz1, n1, sz2, n2;
4)  char muv;
5)  be >> sz1 >> n1 >> sz2 >> n2 >> muv;
6)  while (!be.eof()) {
7)      cout << sz1 << '/' << n1 << ' ' << muv << endl;
8)      be >> sz1 >> n1 >> sz2 >> n2 >> muv;
9)  }
10) be.close();
```

---

### C#  

A conditional loop must also be used here, as we cannot know in advance how many times it will need to repeat. (6) The reading of lines should continue until we reach the end of the file (null).  

**Example in C#:**  
```
1)  using System.IO;
2)  string sor;
3)  string[] reszek;
4)  StreamReader be = new StreamReader(@"g:\adat.txt");
5)  sor = be.ReadLine();
6)  while (sor != null) {
7)      reszek = sor.Split(' ');
8)      Console.Write("\n{0}/{1} {2}", reszek[0], reszek[1], reszek[4]);
9)      sor = be.ReadLine();
10) }
11) be.Close();
```

---



#103

Along with the `while` keyword, we must specify the condition for remaining in the loop. The loop should continue working until there is no empty line, i.e., the line is not null.  

Before each read, we need to make sure, before the loop, whether the file is empty or contains data (5).  
The previously read data must be processed (points (7)-(8)) before the next read can follow (9).  

---

### Exercises  

1. Write a program that displays the contents of the file `adat.txt` on the screen in the following format:  
`24/32 + 8/3 =`. Check that each piece of data appears correctly and exactly once.  

2. Write a program that displays the contents of the file `tavok.txt`. Each line starts with the day number (1 - Monday, 2 - Tuesday, etc.). The content of `tavok.txt` looks like this:  
`1 7 14`  
It should appear on the screen in the following format:  
`Monday 7th trip: 14 km.`  

---

### WHEN THE SEPARATOR IS NOT A SPACE  

What if the separator is not a space? What if multiple separators appear in one read line? Let's examine an example file called `veetel_e.txt` with the following lines:  

```
2/3 ro##s# sz###á#a#y miatt #ak#ovi# id###$#$#$#
0/3 # tt#kon tu##id#o#b#n ko#yk###a#s##ttak##1
13/0 sotete#es##h#ott#eg# ges##alk# hal## #egi# #pata#
```

- The two numbers at the beginning of the line indicate the number of observed wolves: the first number is the number of adults, the second number is the number of pups. The rest is damaged text.  
- Determine and sum how many wolves the sender reported seeing.  
- Each separator in the line: the numeric part needs to be separated from the text by the delimiter. If the separator is `/`, separate the numbers by it, while all other parts are separated by `#`.  


#104



---

**C#**  

We will apply the string variable splitting twice in succession:  

The read line (6) is first split along spaces in the usual way (7). The part we are interested in is at the beginning of the line, so it will be placed in `reszek[0]`. The content of `reszek[0]` will be something like: `2/3`.  

We then cut this string at the `/` character (used as the delimiter). For this, we use the usual `Split` command. As a result of the split, we place the resulting substrings into the `alreszek` array (8), then convert these parts into numbers (9)-(10), so that we can sum them as required by the task (11).  

**Example code in C#:**  
```
1)  StreamReader be = new StreamReader("veetel_e.txt");  
2)  string sor;  
3)  string[] reszek;  
4)  string[] alreszek;  
5)  int felnott, kolyok;  
6)  sor = be.ReadLine();  
7)  reszek = sor.Split(' ');  
8)  alreszek = reszek[0].Split('/');  
9)  felnott = Convert.ToInt16(alreszek[0]);  
10) kolyok = Convert.ToInt16(alreszek[1]);  
11) Console.WriteLine(felnott + kolyok);  
12) be.Close();  
```

---

**C++**  

To solve the task, we need to get familiar with the `getline` instruction. The simplest version, in two parameters, reads either a full line or the rest of the line from a stream (7). The first parameter is the stream from which we read, and the second parameter is a character string where the read data is stored.  

The `getline` instruction can also be used with three parameters (5)-(6). The third parameter reads characters from the line into the variable until it encounters the specified character. The next `getline` instruction with the same character string will continue reading from the position after that character.  

In the example program, we first read up to the `/` character (5) into the `felnottstr` string variable. The next `getline` command reads from the `/` up to the first space (6), and the result is placed into the `kolyokstr` string variable. The rest of the line (up to the end of the line) is read by the next `getline` command (7) into `barmi`.  

**Example code in C++:**  
```
1)  string kolyokstr, felnottstr, barmi;  
2)  stringstream ks, fs;  
3)  int kolyok, felnott;  
4)  fstream be("veetel_e.txt", ios::in);  
5)  getline(be, felnottstr, '/');  
6)  getline(be, kolyokstr, ' ');  
7)  getline(be, barmi);  
8)  fs.clear();  
9)  ks.clear();  
10) fs << felnottstr;  
11) ks << kolyokstr;  
12) fs >> felnott;  
13) ks >> kolyok;  
14) cout << felnott + kolyok << endl;  
15) be.close();  
```

#105


---

**In lines (10)-(13), we convert the character strings into numbers so they can be added together. Finally, we perform the addition and print the result to the screen (14).**

```cpp
1)   stringstream ss, konv;
2)   string felnottt, kolyokstr;
3)   ss << uzenet[i].vett;
4)   getline(ss, felnottt, '/');
5)   getline(ss, kolyokstr, ' ');
6)   konv << felnottt;
7)   konv >> felnott;
8)   konv.clear();
9)   konv << kolyokstr;
10)  konv >> kolyok;
11)  cout << kolyok + felnott << endl;
```

---

### Breaking down a string using stringstream

A stream works similarly. Data can be extracted from a stringstream in the same way as from a filestream. This is shown in the attached example. The data was previously read from a file. The text part shown in the numbered line was read into a character string type variable called `uzenet[i].vett`.  

We create a stringstream (2): this `ss` is needed to break down the character string into text and numbers.  

We load the character string from the file into the `ss` stream (3), which allows it to be broken into parts. We read from the `ss` stream until the `/` delimiter (as in line 2 of the example), and place the result into the `felnottt` character string (6). After the `/` delimiter, we read the next word from the `ss` stream and place its content into `kolyokstr` (in the example, this is the number 3). We convert the number of adult wolves from a character string into an integer (8)-(9), so that later we can add it up. Similarly, we convert the number of young wolves from a character string into an integer (11)-(12). Between the two conversions, we need to clear the stream so that it doesn't overflow (10). Finally, we perform the addition and display the result on the screen (13).

---

### Task

1. Create the file `vetel.txt`. Each line should contain two numbers separated by a `/` character. The first number is the count of adult wolves, and the second number is the count of young wolves. The rest of the line can be random characters, simulating the message. Make sure that the data is read in properly, and the sum is calculated and printed to the screen. Example input:

```
2/3 ro#s# sz###a#y miatt #ka#ovi#
5/7 zso#fi  miat##t elme#n#t
9/12 ##szia## hi#v##j fe#l
13/10 sotette###e#t #eg# ges###l#k hal##t e#g#i # pata#
```

> Note: It is enough to convert the strings to numbers in lines (8)-(9); clearing the stream only becomes necessary if you need to reuse the same stream multiple times.

## STORING DATA IN ARRAYS

There may be cases where data read from a file needs to be stored unchanged. In such situations, we often use array variables. This happens, for example, when we want to change the original order of the data.

The drawback of this method is that it sometimes requires a large amount of memory. Therefore, we only use it if it is absolutely necessary. Otherwise, we process the data line by line directly during reading.

In graduation exam problems, it often draws our attention when they ask us to read the data into an array: “The program should be able to handle an arbitrarily long data file.” Obviously, this is not possible if the amount of data that can be loaded into an array is limited by memory size.

When storing data in memory is necessary, we usually implement this using one- or two-dimensional arrays or record-containing arrays. In C#, before using the data, it may be necessary to convert them — for example, into numbers.

For reading a file of unknown length, it is practical to store the number of lines read into a variable to make further processing easier. The same variable can also be used as an index during reading and storing the data.

Let’s take the following example! Given a file called bsa.txt that contains a DNA sequence (one base per line). We will write a program that displays the reversed sequence in the console, line by line. The DNA consists of up to 1000 bases.

---

**C#**

- In line 2, the variable `i` is used to count how many lines we have read. This variable will also be used as the array index. The first array index is 0.

- In line 4, we create an array of 1000 elements to store the DNA bases.

```csharp
string sor;
int i=0;
int j;
char[] bazis = new char[1000];
StreamReader be = new StreamReader(@"bsa.txt");
sor=be.ReadLine();
while (sor != null) {
    bazis[i] = Convert.ToChar(sor);
    i++;
    sor = be.ReadLine();
}
i--;
for (j = i; j >= 0; j--) 
    Console.Write(bazis[j]);
```

 


#107



---

**IV. HANDLING TEXT FILES | 107**

In line 8, we store the currently read base. Since C# only reads lines, we need to convert these strings into individual characters.  
The program also reads the last, empty line, so the array index (i) must be decreased by one before further use. This happens in line 12.  
For printing in reverse order, we use a counting loop that starts from the last array index (i) and counts backward to index 0, printing the array elements in reverse. This happens in lines 13 and 14. The loop variable is j, declared in line 3.

**C++**

In line 1, we declare variable i, which will help us count how many lines we've read. This variable will be used as the array index. The first index is 0.  
In line 3, we create an array for the DNS base with space for 1000 elements.  
In line 5 (and during the loop’s operation in line 8), the currently read base is stored.  
The program also reads the end-of-file marker, so the array index (i) must be decreased by one before further use. This happens in line 10.  
For printing in reverse order, we use a counting loop starting from the last index (i) and counting back to 0, printing the array elements in reverse. This happens in lines 11 and 12. The loop variable is j, declared in line 2.

**Code:**
```cpp
1.  int i=0;
2.  int j;
3.  char bazis[1000];
4.  fstream be("bsa.txt", ios::in);
5.  be >> bazis[i];
6.  while (!be.eof()) {
7.      i++;
8.      be >> bazis[i];
9.  }
10. i--;
11. for (j=i; j>=0; j--)
12.     cout << bazis[j];
```

### Exercises

1. Given a `bsa.txt` file containing a DNA sequence (each line contains a single base). Write a program to display the DNA sequence on the screen in reverse order, line by line. The DNA consists of at most 1000 bases. (Try to solve it on your own. If not, the previous pages will help.)

2. Write a program that reads the contents of the `kep.txt` file into three one-dimensional arrays (let’s name them, for example, `r`, `g`, and `b`). Each line of the file contains pixel data in RGB format. The image is 50x50 pixels. As a check, print the colors on the screen in a 50x50 character table in the following way:  
   - **P**: red — RGB (255,0,0)  
   - **Z**: green — RGB (0,255,0)  
   - **K**: blue — RGB (0,0,255)  
   - **S**: yellow — RGB (255,255,0)  
   - **.**: other

**IV. HANDLING TEXT FILES | 109**

## WRITING TO A TEXT FILE

The writing operation starts with opening the file (1). If the file does not exist, the file stream creates it. By default, if the file exists, reopening it will completely overwrite its old contents. So it will not append but overwrite. The rules for specifying the file path are the same as for reading.  

After opening the file, we can start writing to it. We can imagine the process as if we were writing to the screen. Even the commands are very similar. (2) The opened file continuously expands with the content being written to it. The most recently written data always goes to the end of the file.  

Writing to a file also has a closing protocol. The file stream must first be emptied so that no data loss occurs due to the buffer effect. If we do not do this, there could still be data left in the stream that has not been written to disk. Flushing can be done with the `flush` command (3). After this, the file can be closed in the familiar way (4).

### C# version:
```
1. StreamWriter ki = new StreamWriter(@"szuletes.txt");
2. ki.Write("Hello Világ");
3. ki.Flush();
4. ki.Close();
```

### C++ version:
```
1. fstream ki("szuletes.txt", ios::out);
2. ki << "Hello vilag" << endl;
3. ki.flush();
4. ki.close();
```

A file can also be extended later. In this case, the file stream must be opened in a different way from the default. In append mode, the data will always be added to the end of the file. Extending files is not a graduation requirement.

### C#:
```
StreamWriter ki = new StreamWriter(@"szuletes.txt", append: true);
```

### C++:
```
ofstream ki("szuletes.txt", ios::app);
```

#110



---

**Task**

1. Write a program that writes our name and date of birth into a file called `szuletes.txt`.

2. Write a program that reads the content of the file `adat.txt` line by line, and immediately writes each line into a file called `szamok.txt` in the following format:  
   24/32 + 8/3 =  

3. Write a program that writes 50 lines of random data into a text file called `telkek`. In each line, there should be a house number, a plot width, and a plot length, separated by spaces. For example:  
   21 15 50  
   House numbers should be between 1 and 50. The data should be realistic. If you haven’t learned arrays yet, write the random data directly to the file.

4. Write a program that writes 100 lines of random data into a text file called `tortek`. In each line, there should be four items: three positive integers under 100 and one arithmetic operator, separated by spaces. For example:  
   8 20 8 30 *  
   Possible operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `:`.

Programs write to both the console window and files in a similar manner. Both use buffers, as we saw at the beginning of file handling. If we redirect the buffer address used for the screen (where console window data is stored in memory) to the address of a file buffer, then instructions that normally write to the console window (Console.Write, cout) will write to the file instead.  

Let’s say we’ve created a program part that displays data on the screen, and now we need to write the same data into a text file. The simplest solution is to redirect console output to a file and then run that part of the program again. If we don’t do this, we’d need to create two blocks of code for displaying the data: once on the screen and once into the file, which would mean extra work and duplication of code.  

**Code snippet and operation**  

We save the screen buffer address in a variable called *eredeti* ("original") in lines (14)-(15). This is necessary because after writing to the file, we’ll want to write to the screen again, and we’ll need to restore the original address for console instructions.  

- We display the output on the screen in the usual way (lines 16-17).  
- We create a filestream and open it for writing in the usual way (lines 18-19).  
- We redirect the screen buffer to the file buffer (line 20).  
- We write the data into the file as if writing to the console (line 21).  
- Since we no longer need the file, we flush the buffer (line 22) and close the file (line 23).  

I would like to especially point out that, based on my experience, using the flush command is really necessary. Otherwise, in about 100% of cases, data loss occurs.  

- We restore the console window’s output stream to its original place (line 24), redirecting the output back to the screen. The *eredeti* variable contains the screen buffer address.  
- We write to the screen again to see if the redirection worked (line 25).

```csharp
14  TextWriter original = Console.Out;
15  Console.WriteLine("Output to monitor");
16  StreamWriter ki = new StreamWriter("result.txt");
17  Console.SetOut(ki);
18  Console.WriteLine("Writing to file");
19  ki.Flush();
20  ki.Close();
21  Console.SetOut(original);
22  Console.WriteLine("Back to monitor");
```

```cpp
14  streambuf* original = cout.rdbuf();
15  cout << "Output to monitor." << endl;
16  fstream ki("result.txt", ios::out);
17  cout.rdbuf(ki.rdbuf());
18  cout << "Writing to file.";
19  ki.flush();
20  ki.close();
21  cout.rdbuf(original);
22  cout << "Back to monitor.";
```

### Task  

Let’s create the 15x15 multiplication table on the screen. Without duplicating the code, also write it into a file called *szorzotabla.txt*. At the end of the program, display the message *"Done"* on the screen.

**IV. HANDLING TEXT FILES | 113**  

### FREQUENT QUESTIONS  

**End of line**  

How does the read command know where the end of a line is? Or to put it differently: how does Notepad know where to start a new line when displaying the data? (The read command knows this the same way Notepad does.) The answer is simple: at the end of every line, there is an end-of-line symbol. This consists of two bytes, with values 13 and 10, meaning hexadecimal 0D and 0A. Naturally, if you look at the file with Notepad, you cannot see these bytes. So how do we know they actually exist? Certain programs can display files byte by byte. With such a program, you can examine a text file, and the end-of-line characters will appear before each line. (In the image below, you can see the first few lines of the file `adat.txt`. Don’t hesitate to look at end-of-line characters, even if you already know the data.)  

**Next line**  

How does the read command know to jump to the next line? Its operation is described in such a way that it always reads the first line found in the stream. After that, the data is removed from the stream, making room for the next line.  

**Reading from an arbitrary line**  

Is it possible to start reading from any arbitrary line? In a certain sense, yes; but not really. Yes, because we can read in 9 lines from the start of the file without doing anything with them, then read the 10th line and display only that on the screen, without using the others. But no, because to reach the later lines, we still have to read the previous lines first. There are file handling methods that allow us to jump directly to the 10th line, but those are not used for free-form text files; instead, they are used for fixed-length records (records), and in general, are not suitable for processing regular text files.

**Data Modification**  
The modification of the text files introduced can be done by reading the lines one after another, rewriting the data to be modified, writing it into another file, and finally renaming the new file to the old one. This method is a bit forced and time-consuming. Anyone who needs this level of data handling should use a database rather than dealing with text files. It is possible to connect to database servers and embed SQL commands into the program code, making databases accessible.

### SUMMARY

**Instructions for simple text file handling**

| Task | C++ Example | C# Example |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Function library, namespace | `include <fstream>` | `using System.IO` |
| Declaring stream for reading | `fstream be("d:\\adat.txt", ios::in);` | `StreamReader be = new StreamReader("adat.txt");` |
| Reading | `be >> valtozo1 >> valtozo2;` | `sor = be.ReadLine();` |
| End of file | `be.eof()` | `sor == null` |
| Closing file | `be.close();` | `be.Close();` |
| Declaring stream for writing | `fstream ki("d:\\tort.txt", ios::out);` | `StreamWriter ki = new StreamWriter(@"d:\adat.txt");` |
| Writing to file | `ki << "kiirando" << v;` | `ki.Write("kiirando {0}", v);`<br>`ki.WriteLine(valtozo);` |
| Flushing buffer | `ki.flush();` | `ki.Flush();` |
| Declaring stream for appending | `ofstream ki("d:\\tort.txt", ios::app);` | `StreamWriter ki = new StreamWriter(@"d:\adat.txt", append: true);` |
| Console buffer pointer | `streambuf *e = cout.rdbuf();` | `TextWriter e = Console.Out;` |
| Redirecting console buffer | `cout.rdbuf(ki.rdbuf());` | `Console.SetOut(ki);` |
| Reading line up to character (/) or end of line | `getline(be, felnottstr, '/');` | - |

### File Reading Process

In case of an unknown number of lines:

1. Open the file (file name, reading)
2. Read one line from the file
3. Loop until end of file
4. Process the line:  
   splitting, converting,  
   output, executing operations, etc.
5. Move to the next array index, if there is an array
6. Read one line from the file
7. Close the file
8. Use the previous array index, if there is an array

sor = be.ReadLine();
while (sor != null)
{
    bazis[i] = Convert.ToChar(sor);
    Console.Write(bazis[i]);
    i++;
    sor = be.ReadLine();
}
i--;
