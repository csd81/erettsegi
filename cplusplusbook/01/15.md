### **TL;DR (Summary of the Page)**

#### **Commercial vs. Free Development Environments**
- **Business-oriented development environments** speed up programming by **automatically generating parts of the code**.
- The main **drawback** is their **high cost**, which is justified for large software companies but not for small businesses or individual developers.
- **"Baiting" strategy**: Many free versions exist for educational purposes, but **commercial use requires a paid license**.
- **Example:** A developer learned to code in a free environment but later realized that he needed a **paid license to sell software**, forcing him to **rewrite his project in a free IDE** over three years.

- **Visual Studio Express** is a **free** example, suitable for **education but not commercial use**.
- For business development, **Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise** is required, or **Visual Studio Community**, which has limitations.

#### **Programming Errors (HibÃ¡k)**
- Errors **disrupt program execution** and can make it fail.
- Errors fall into **two main categories**:  
  - **Syntactic errors (Szintaktikai hibÃ¡k)**  
  - **Semantic errors (Szemantikai hibÃ¡k)** (not covered on this page).

##### **Syntactic Errors**
- **Occur when the compiler rejects the code** due to **language rules violations**.
- Common causes:
  - **Misspelling** (e.g., missing a letter in a command).
  - **Forgetting mandatory characters** (e.g., `;` at the end of a statement).
  - **Unmatched parentheses** (missing opening or closing).

- **Debugging syntactic errors:**
  - They are **easy to find** by carefully checking the code.
  - Development environments help by **highlighting** the errors.
  - **Compiler error messages** often help locate and fix mistakes.
