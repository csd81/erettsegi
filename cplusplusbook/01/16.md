### **TL;DR (Summary of Pages 16-17)**

#### **Semantic Errors (Szemantikai hib√°k)**
- A program with **semantic errors** can compile, but it **does not behave as expected**.
- It may produce **incorrect results**, crash, or cause a **runtime error**.
- These errors are **harder to detect** than syntax errors.
- The best way to find them is through **testing**.
- Some bugs may remain hidden for **years** before they are discovered.
- These persistent errors are commonly called **"bugs"**.

#### **Development = Coding + Immediate Testing**
- Ideal programming practice involves **writing code and testing immediately**.
- Testing ensures that mistakes are caught **early**.
- Some developers **write large chunks of code before testing**, which makes debugging **much harder**.
- Beginners should **test each instruction or parameter** as they go.
- Over time, programmers learn to **balance coding and testing frequency**.
