Here’s the English translation of the Hungarian text on the image:

**7.** Click the **OK** button. After a short wait, Visual Studio will create the project with its necessary structure, and the code editor will appear where you can write your program.

**8.** We will start our programs in a block beginning with **static void Main**. Find this, and place the cursor between the parentheses that follow. Press Enter. The cursor will blink in the line between the parentheses.

**9.** To display something on the text screen (console window), we can use the **Console.WriteLine** command. Inside the parentheses and quotation marks, we can specify the text to be displayed. *Type it character by character, exactly, paying attention to uppercase and lowercase letters:*

```
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
```

**10.** If we now run the program, the console window will briefly appear, display the text, and then immediately close. This happens so quickly that we would only see a flash. Let's give another instruction that waits for input from us, like pressing Enter. This will keep the console window open. *Type it character by character, exactly, paying attention to uppercase and lowercase letters:*

```
Console.ReadLine();
```

**11.** The completed program must be compiled into machine code, then run to operate. This two-step process can be done at once in the development environment by clicking the **Start** button. The result will be a black window with white characters showing the text "Hello World!".

**12.** If the program doesn’t work, we should look for the error(s). The development environment can help with this by underlining the error and listing its description and the line number in the **Error List** window below. After fixing the error, we can restart the program.
