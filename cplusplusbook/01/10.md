The page you uploaded discusses two key topics related to programming:

### **1. Console Applications (Konzol Alkalmaz√°sok)**
- Console applications are text-based programs that display output in a console.
- For the **informatika √©retts√©gi (informatics exam)**, it's required to provide **textual explanations** for input and output data.
- The significance of console applications is that they are **easy to use for learning software techniques**.
- In some cases, graphical interfaces are unnecessary or impractical due to technical or financial constraints.
- For **web development**, appearance is important, and UI design requires significant human effort, often involving web designers.

### **2. Algorithms (Algoritmus)**
#### **Definition of an Algorithm (Algoritmus fogalma)**
- An **algorithm** is a **series of steps** that solves a specific problem.
- Examples of algorithms include:
  - Cooking recipes.
  - Step-by-step assembly guides.
  - Descriptions of chemical experiments.
  - Methods for prime factorization of numbers.
- Instructions in an algorithm are typically **commands** (e.g., "Crack three eggs!").

#### **Algorithm Description Tools (Algoritmus le√≠r√≥ eszk√∂z√∂k)**
- Algorithms are usually written **independently of programming languages**.
- Advantages:
  - They are more **concise and clear**.
  - They can be understood by **non-programmers**.
- The simplest way to describe an algorithm is through **textual descriptions** (e.g., cooking recipes).
