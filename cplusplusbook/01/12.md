This page discusses **algorithm development (algorithmization)** and **machine code programming**.

### **1. Algorithmization (AlgoritmizÃ¡lÃ¡s)**
- **Algorithmization** is the process of **creating an algorithm**.
- Sometimes, the sequence of steps is immediately **clear**, while in other cases, it requires **longer consideration and different techniques**.
- In some cases, a **problem may not have a solution**.
- It is easier to create an algorithm if **a known pattern, formula, or method** can be applied.

### **2. Programming Languages: Machine Code (GÃ©pi kÃ³d)**
- In the early days, computers were programmed **directly in machine code**.
- This meant entering program **bytes manually** into the computer.
- The **example in the image** shows a **Commodore Plus/4 memory dump**, where machine code is stored.
- Each number in **hexadecimal format (e.g., A9, 8D, 02, FF)** represents a **single byte**.
- Machine code follows the **Von Neumann architecture**, where **instructions and data are stored in the same memory**.

#### **Understanding the Example**
- **A9** is a simple **instruction**.
- **02** is a **data value** (representing a color code).
- **8D** is another **instruction**, and its next values form an **address (FF19h)** where the screen color is stored.

#### **Challenges of Machine Code**
- Writing programs in **machine code** is **time-consuming and requires expertise**.
- A programmer must understand how the **processor "thinks"** and how instructions work.

#### **Machine Code Today**
- **Modern computers still execute machine code**, but **programmers no longer write it directly**.
- Most executable files (e.g., **.exe files on Windows**) contain **machine code**.
- Machine code is also referred to as **binary code**.

### **Summary**
- **Algorithmization** helps design solutions effectively.
- **Machine code** was the original way to program computers but is now used mostly in compiled software.
- **Hexadecimal notation** is commonly used to represent machine instructions and data.
