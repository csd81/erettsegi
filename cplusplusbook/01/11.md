This page discusses **different ways to describe algorithms**, focusing on **flowcharts and pseudocode**.

### **1. Algorithm Description Methods**
- **Flowcharts (Folyamat√°br√°k)**:
  - Used for visualizing **short algorithms**.
  - Steps are represented using **different geometric shapes**.
  - The sequence is indicated using **arrows**.
  - Advantage: **Easy to understand and visually clear**.
  - Disadvantage: **Graphical elements take up space**, making it difficult to represent **larger algorithms**.

- **Pseudocode (Mondatszer≈± le√≠r√°s)**:
  - A **text-based** way to describe an algorithm.
  - More structured than natural language but does not follow the strict syntax of a programming language.
  - It uses a **fixed set of predefined sentence elements**.
  - Often used as an intermediate step before writing actual code.

- Other methods exist, such as **structured text descriptions** like **Jackson diagrams or structured flowcharts**, but they are beyond the scope of this book.

### **2. Representing an Algorithm with a Flowchart**
- Example Task:  
  - Ask the user for two numbers.  
  - Add them together.  
  - Display the result.
- Flowchart representation (as shown in the image):
  - **Parallelogram** represents **input/output**.
  - **Rectangle** represents **calculations and assignments**.
  - **Start and Stop** symbols indicate the **beginning and end** of the algorithm.

### **3. Representing an Algorithm with Pseudocode**
- The same task written in **pseudocode**:
  ```
  Be: a
  Be: b
  c = a + b
  Ki: c
  ```
  - **Be:** (input) means the user enters a value.
  - **c = a + b:** performs the addition.
  - **Ki:** (output) displays the result.
