helloThe page you uploaded contains an introduction to the general structure of a program. Here’s a summary:

### **General Structure of a Program**
A computer program consists of three main components:
1. **Data Structure (Adatszerkezet)**  
   - Programs need to store data (either persistent or temporary).  
   - Various data structures are used, such as variables, files, and databases.  
   - Choosing the right data structure is essential for an efficient program.

2. **Business Logic (Üzleti logika)**  
   - Also called "application logic" (Alkalmazás logika).  
   - Defines how the program operates and what actions it takes.  
   - This is the core functionality of the program, separate from user interaction.

3. **User Interface (Felhasználói felület)**  
   - Where the user interacts with the program.  
   - Includes messages, outputs, and queries from the program.  
   - Can be graphical (Windows UI), web-based, or text-based.  
   - Needs to be clear and user-friendly.
