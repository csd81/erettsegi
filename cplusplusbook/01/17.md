#### **Data Streams (Adatfolyamok)**
- **Data streams** (Hungarian: *adatfolyamok*, English: *streams*) refer to **sequential data transfer** between the **CPU and peripherals** (e.g., monitor, storage).
- Streams ensure that **bytes are received in the correct order**.
- Example: Characters typed into a console appear **in order** on the screen.

##### **Buffering (PufferelÃ©s)**
- **Buffers** are memory areas where data **temporarily waits** before being processed.
- **Why buffers matter:**  
  - If a **peripheral is too slow** to handle incoming data, a buffer prevents **data loss**.
  - Example: A hard drive **buffers** data before writing it.
- **Buffers exist in both directions**:
  - **From CPU to peripherals** (e.g., displaying text on a screen).
  - **From peripherals to CPU** (e.g., reading data from a keyboard).
