### **TL;DR (Summary of the Page)**

- **Algorithmization**: The process of creating algorithms. Some problems are easily structured into steps, while others require deeper thought. Recognizing familiar patterns and formulas makes algorithm creation easier.

- **Machine Code (GÃ©pi kÃ³d)**:  
  - Early computers were programmed directly in machine code by entering **byte values** manually.  
  - Example shown: A **Commodore Plus/4** memory dump where hex values represent machine instructions and data.  
  - Machine code follows the **Von Neumann architecture**, where **instructions and data are stored together**.  
  - Writing machine code is **complex and time-consuming**, requiring deep knowledge of hardware.  
  - Modern computers still execute **binary code** (e.g., **.exe files on Windows**), but programmers no longer write it manually.
