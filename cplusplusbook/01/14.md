### **TL;DR (Summary of the Page)**

#### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- As software became **larger and more complex**, traditional structured programming was **too slow and inefficient**.
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** was developed as a **better method**.
- It extended existing high-level languages (**C, Pascal, Basic**) into **C++, C#, Java, Object Pascal, Delphi**, etc.
- OOP source code is compiled into **binary (machine code)**.
- OOP programs tend to be **larger and slower** compared to structured programming (e.g., Windows applications).

#### **Graphical Development Environments**
- Modern development demands **faster and more efficient programming**, requiring **graphical IDEs**.
- IDEs (e.g., **Visual Studio**) allow developers to **drag-and-drop** UI elements like **buttons and menus** without manually coding them.
- Some IDEs even support **graphical logic flow (e.g., loops)**.
- **Trade-off**: More user-friendly environments lead to **larger and slower** compiled programs.
- Some parts of the code in **graphical IDEs cannot be manually modified**â€”only the development environment can access them.

#### **Commercial vs. Free Development Environments**
- **Free IDEs** are usually **less advanced, harder to use, and lack features** compared to commercial ones.
- Example: **Code::Blocks** focuses mainly on **writing code** but is **not ideal for Windows GUI development**.
